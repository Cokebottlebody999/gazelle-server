# This is both the template for the file we use for all our           #
# configuration, and at the same time the 'source code' that our      #
# script `setup.js` uses to provide headers, titles, comments and     #
# variable assignments. You're welcome to manually copy this file to  #
# `.env` and fill it out but the file is formatted to be compatible   #
# with `setup.js`.                                                    #
# The 'syntax' is:                                                    #
# - This first box is ignored (denoted by # at start and end of line) #
# - The rest of boxes like this are section headers and are printed   #
#   as is                                                             #
# - Comments (no # at end of line) are denoted by two #s in a row     #
# - Subtitles (again no # at end of line) are denoted by one #        #
