# Managing / Setting Up our Slack Bot

We use a Slack bot to deliver dev ops messages from our staging and production servers to the team. There is an overall guide for using bot users here: https://api.slack.com/bot-users. It now recommends making a real Slack App to manage even private bots, so feel free to do that if you ever have to set up a new one, but when we initially created our bot it recommended using custom integrations which is what we have, and is easier to manage. To manage the config of our Slack Bot (things like getting the API token, changing the name, channels it is allowed to use, or profile picture), you should click `administration` > `manage apps` from the workspace. Then go to `Custom Integrations`, where you should see an integration called `Bots`. If you click that and click the `edit configuration` button (the icon at the time of writing is a pencil) you should see and be able to edit all the information you need.
