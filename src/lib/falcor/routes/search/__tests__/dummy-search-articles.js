It is as though I am in a potato factory. Oh wait I am. Please bear with me potating all this garbage. You might have guessed that one of the search queries would be potatoes.
I met many angry potatoes here. The bigger ones would eat the samller ones and become even bigger. The harder ones would eat the squishy ones and become harder.
It was a potato colony. One king potato ruled them all.`,

      Let us understand that football is not a sport for all. Some fouls in football are so harsh that it could make big boys cry.
      My favourite sport is actually basketall. But I love sports, and in this spirit of loving I have chosen to be unbiased.
      Hence, this article shall be about football. And football it is about. Amazing`,

      Accoring to the search, article 3, which is about you-know-what has more mentions of it in the body whereas this one only has it in the title.
      The expected result would obviously be that article three be above this one in the search results. Ingenious, isn't it?`,

      His name, forevermore, was Emilio. He was a fine hobbit, with an intelligence far greater than any known living hobbit.
      He recruited members of his team from the ranks of men, of dragons, of trolls, or orcs, of dwarves, and he even managed to get himself a wizard.
      This wizard had genius abilities, but was a young wizard in his early years. He had much to learn, and Emilio was a great teacher.`,
