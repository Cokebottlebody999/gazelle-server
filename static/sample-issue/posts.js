The editors are committed to operating as editorially and financially independent of the university. The Gazelle is an online platform available to the public because the editors believe students interested in professional journalism will not settle on publishing their work when they cannot share it, via social media or email, with people outside the institution. The editors believe that a thoughtful, structured and self-consciously public publication will provide this while creating a framework for constructive discourse. This is the best medium for hosting student voices, stories and ideas than alternative forms of publication. At a time when anyone can publish their work online we see it not only important but vital that students do so collectively.</p> <p>Opinions expressed in The Gazelle are by editors or columnists and are not those of The Gazelle. Unsigned editorials are all the collective opinion of the Editorial Board. The Gazelle encourages readers to voice their opinions respectfully.

I had been working in the study room of my dorm building, trying to keep my eyes on an increasingly blurry paragraph about colonial perspectives of late 19th-century Africa. Sitting across from me was a friend who had her head down, in a nap that was probably half-intentional. It was around 12:30 a.m.</p>\n\n<p>I stood up, closed my book mid-page and decided to go to bed. The ten hours of sleep that followed were the best I\u2019d had all semester, even if they weren\u2019t entirely guilt-free.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that senior year is supposed to be stressful, that university is a time of intense study and burgeoning caffeine addiction. But as we pile on assignments and Google Calendar events, wrenching the mechanisms of our bodies into various working modes, the knowledge that fellow students are doing the same should not be comforting. Academia is about intellectual prowess and curiosity; but sometimes, while struggling to keep our eyes open for the next paragraph, the next hour, it can feel more like a test of physical endurance.</p>\n\n<p>Health in today\u2019s world is increasingly valorized and glamorized; we see it in the spreads of lifestyle magazines, in the green gleam of an Instagrammed avocado. As someone who was once spotted drinking yoghurt through a straw, I do not particularly consider myself an authority on health trends or #eatingclean. But I\u2019m glad that NYU Abu Dhabi has been encouraging students to talk about wellbeing on-campus, and that mental health is becoming a bigger part of that conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Various articles in this issue focus on one specific aspect of health, but their overall aim is to acknowledge the fact that often, mental and physical become inseparable. I realized this during a semester abroad in Morocco, after a bout of stomach illness left me suddenly sick, the sickest I\u2019d ever been in my life. A clinic trip, a couple injections and a week of rice and carrots later, I was more or less better. But there lingered an inherent discomfort with how quickly, how spectacularly and powerfully, my own digestive system had betrayed me. I had never broken a bone, never even had a cavity. The months that followed left me grappling with my relationship to my own body, one that I now felt alienated and estranged from.</p>\n\n<p>Bodies and minds have limits, weaknesses, moments of malfunction. Truly recovering from my illness began with acknowledging these boundaries and learning how to respect them. It is not just a lifestyle, but also an incredibly difficult and taxing mindset. More than anything, health means taking care of yourself. It means sometimes putting your interests before others. It means going to bed when you need to go to bed.</p>\n\n<p>The Gazelle\u2019s hope for this issue was to show the full diversity of health at NYUAD, in all its mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and interpersonal facets. It does not aim to promote certain lifestyles or ways of thinking, but rather to make visible campus efforts that have been ongoing for a while. This issue was only possible thanks to the students who opened up about their individual experiences with health and wellbeing. We hope that their stories prove helpful and inspiring, and that they can serve as landmarks for a conversation which still has a long way to go.</p>\n\n<p>[big<em>image]<a href=\"http://thegazelle.s3.amazonaws.com/gazelle/2015/10/joey.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142421\" src=\"http://thegazelle.s3.amazonaws.com/gazelle/2015/10/joey.png\" alt=\"joey\" width=\"1990\" height=\"1132\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Joey</h3>  \n\n<p>I started to think that something was wrong last semester, in the spring of my junior year. It was a night that my roommate and I had carved out for studying. We had many nights like that \u2014 each sitting at her desk for hours, maybe a break for cheese and jam and then back to work until we collapsed from exhaustion. That night, at about 2 a.m., we heard somebody screaming for help.</p>\n\n<p>It isn\u2019t my place to say any more about the incident except what it taught me about myself. Without minding it, I had fallen into a very single-minded routine for work efficiency, and this incident blindsided me. Somebody I saw regularly had been in trouble and I didn\u2019t notice.</p>\n\n<p>My roommate said something that I can\u2019t forget: \u201cWe hear it this time, but think of all the people who don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I saw that my priorities were lopsided. Narrow. Selfish. Over the years at NYU Abu Dhabi, I had fine-tuned and chiseled down my focus so well on intellectual, academic and career goals. Coming back from study abroad helped me see how much sharper this focus becomes on Saadiyat Campus. The emphasis and demand are always on self-improvement \u2014 already a self-centered realm. Narrower still is that the areas of self-improvement tend to fall heavily, if not entirely, on academia and career. Perhaps that\u2019s what university is for, and I couldn\u2019t blame it for creating such an environment. I could blame myself.</p>\n\n<p>Coming out of that night, I decided that one of my goals is friendship. The same way that we set goals for classes, extra-curriculars and career, I wanted to set and work toward friendship goals. To commit time, energy and care to relationships. I\u2019m not doing it perfectly now, but I\u2019m working on it.</p>\n\n<p>It is my hope that this special issue on health will help bring to light the struggles that many of us, and many other university students, continue to confront \u2014 whether overtly or silently. Maybe it will help others come out of the same kind of narrow vision that I had. Maybe it will remind us to take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p>Joey Bui and Zo\u00eb Hu are co-editors-in-chief.

The ten hours of sleep that followed were the best I\u2019d had all semester, even if they weren\u2019t entirely guilt-free.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that senior year is supposed to be stressful, that university is a time of intense study and burgeoning caffeine addiction. But as we pile on assignments and Google Calendar events, wrenching the mechanisms of our bodies into various working modes, the knowledge that fellow students are doing the same should not be comforting. Academia is about intellectual prowess and curiosity; but sometimes, while struggling to keep our eyes open for the next paragraph, the next hour, it can feel more like a test of physical endurance.\n\nHealth in today\u2019s world is increasingly valorized and glamorized; we see it in the spreads of lifestyle magazines, in the green gleam of an Instagrammed avocado. As someone who was once spotted drinking yoghurt through a straw, I do not particularly consider myself an authority on health trends or #eatingclean. But I\u2019m glad that NYU Abu Dhabi has been encouraging students to talk about wellbeing on campus, and that mental health is becoming a bigger part of that conversation.\n\nVarious articles in this issue focus on one specific aspect of health, but their overall aim is to acknowledge the fact that often, mental and physical become inseparable. I realized this during a semester abroad in Morocco, after a bout of stomach illness left me suddenly sick, the sickest I\u2019d ever been in my life. A clinic trip, a couple injections and a week of rice and carrots later, I was more or less better. But there lingered an inherent discomfort with how quickly, how spectacularly and powerfully, my own digestive system had betrayed me. I had never broken a bone, never even had a cavity. The months that followed left me grappling with my relationship to my own body, one that I now felt alienated and estranged from.\n\nBodies and minds have limits, weaknesses, moments of malfunction. Truly recovering from my illness began with acknowledging these boundaries and learning how to respect them. It is not just a lifestyle, but also an incredibly difficult and taxing mindset. More than anything, health means taking care of yourself. It means sometimes putting your interests before others. It means going to bed when you need to go to bed.\n\nThe Gazelle\u2019s hope for this issue was to show the full diversity of health at NYUAD, in all its mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and interpersonal facets. It does not aim to promote certain lifestyles or ways of thinking, but rather to make visible campus efforts that have been ongoing for a while. This issue was only possible thanks to the students who opened up about their individual experiences with health and wellbeing. We hope that their stories prove helpful and inspiring, and that they can serve as landmarks for a conversation which still has a long way to go.\n\n<a href=\"http://thegazelle.s3.amazonaws.com/gazelle/2015/10/joey.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142421\" src=\"http://thegazelle.s3.amazonaws.com/gazelle/2015/10/joey.png\" alt=\"joey\" width=\"1990\" height=\"1132\" /></a>\n<h3>Joey</h3>\nI started to think that something was wrong last semester, in the spring of my junior year. It was a night that my roommate and I had carved out for studying. We had many nights like that \u2014 each sitting at her desk for hours, maybe a break for cheese and jam and then back to work until we collapsed from exhaustion. That night, at about 2 a.m., we heard somebody screaming for help.\n\nIt isn\u2019t my place to say any more about the incident except what it taught me about myself. Without minding it, I had fallen into a very single-minded routine for work efficiency, and this incident blindsided me. Somebody I saw regularly had been in trouble and I didn\u2019t notice.\n\nMy roommate said something that I can\u2019t forget: \u201cWe hear it this time, but think of all the people who don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d\n\nI saw that my priorities were lopsided. Narrow. Selfish. Over the years at NYU Abu Dhabi, I had fine-tuned and chiseled down my focus so well on intellectual, academic and career goals. Coming back from study abroad helped me see how much sharper this focus becomes on Saadiyat Campus. The emphasis and demand are always on self-improvement \u2014 already a self-centered realm. Narrower still is that the areas of self-improvement tend to fall heavily, if not entirely, on academia and career. Perhaps that\u2019s what university is for, and I couldn\u2019t blame it for creating such an environment. I could blame myself.\n\nComing out of that night, I decided that one of my goals is friendship. The same way that we set goals for classes, extra-curriculars and career, I wanted to set and work toward friendship goals. To commit time, energy and care to relationships. I\u2019m not doing it perfectly now, but I\u2019m working on it.\n\nIt is my hope that this special issue on health will help bring to light the struggles that many of us, and many other university students, continue to confront \u2014 whether overtly or silently. Maybe it will help others come out of the same kind of narrow vision that I had. Maybe it will remind us to take care of each other.\n\nJoey Bui and Zo\u00eb Hu are co-editors-in-chief.

Although no such statistics exist for NYU Abu Dhabi or other universities in the region, a lack of official numbers does not mean the issue itself is non-existent. Three NYUAD students opened up to share their stories about anorexia, bulimia and recovery both on and of-campus.   </p>\n\n<h3>\u201cYOU HAVE YOUR LIFE IN YOUR OWN HANDS\u201d</h3>  \n\n<p>\u201cIn [my home country], a girl is only considered pretty if she is skinny. That just goes hand in hand,\u201d said Victoria, who asked that her real name not be used.</p>\n\n<p>Leaning back against the plush chair in my living room, fingers curled around a mug of tea, she began to tell her story of bulimia. Her eating disorder, she said, had a very clear starting point; while on holiday with her parents during a school break, she inadvertently lost a couple of pounds and enjoyed the reactions she received.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I went back to school, my peers, for some reason, had a very easy time noticing that I had lost weight and they started making comments about how good I looked,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never heard that before \u2026 and I really liked it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Victoria went home after school that day and, with the praise of her friends still echoing in her mind, decided that she didn\u2019t feel hungry. She embarked on a diet, focusing on eating healthily at first.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI lost some more weight,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I started throwing up after every meal because I realized that there were some days when I was super hungry and I was eating like I used to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Her parents must have realized what was happening, she said, when they heard her purging after meals. At one point, her mother had to take her shopping nearly every week to buy clothes in smaller and smaller sizes. Victoria appreciated that they did not directly intervene, however, but instead supported her while making the costs of continuing clear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for all the girls and guys out there who have had an eating disorder but for me, it was about having control in my life,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cBulimia and eating disorders in general make you feel very much like you are in control. You know that almost everyone out there wants to lose weight \u2026 And when you start losing weight so rapidly, you realize that you\u2019ve got this. You have your life in your own hands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, however, Victoria felt that her bulimia was spiraling out of control. She knew it had to stop. Although she is very grateful that bulimia is no longer a part of her life, she said she wouldn\u2019t take back that period of her life if she had the chance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf I could turn back time, I wouldn\u2019t do anything differently,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cTo begin with, I don\u2019t know if I would even be here at this amazing university had it not been for bulimia and the huge jump in my GPA \u2026 and it taught me about my relationships with my friends and my parents, and with myself and my body, with academics, everything.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to recognize that, but it\u2019s not always such a bad thing. This sounds twisted and bad, but I really think so,\u201d she added.</p>\n\n<h3>DE-GLAMORIZING ANOREXIA</h3>  \n\n<p>Monica, who also requested that her name not be published, emphasized that she did not want to glamorize her eating disorder in any way.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTalking about it is so important because as long as you think it is glamorous and as long as you think you are doing the best thing for you \u2014 which you will think when you have an eating disorder \u2014 it\u2019s easy to associate eating disorders with notions of beauty or control or purity, these kind of abstract ideals that really at the core of it don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>She painted a brutal picture of what it was like to live with an eating disorder and of how bad her anorexia became for her health and well-being.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I see photos of myself then, yeah, I looked vaguely presentable with enough makeup,\u201d Monica said. \u201cBut my eyes were sallow and I looked sick. I was bruised all over. I couldn\u2019t lay on my bed because my bones were digging into me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d she added. \u201cBut until you start sharing those anecdotes with other women, you think that what we present on the street is what we are, which is not the case.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Monica and I were in the library late at night, and had wandered off to find a secluded place to talk away from the florescent lights and clacking of keyboards in the common area. We eventually settled in the back, hidden amongst a row of books, and talked for more than an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Monica told me that she had counted calories and restricted food since about the age of eleven, but her eating disorder worsened during the gap between high school and university. A lot was happening in her personal and home life at the time, and the drive she would have devoted to academics found its release in starvation and self-destructive behaviors. Starting university did not put an end to it, but only made it much worse.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe ability to be anonymous in college and to pass things off as \u2018Oh, I have too much work\u2019 \u2014 which is always the case here \u2014 it made it much easier to escalate things,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are in that mindset, it\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks before the end of her freshman year, she had to take a leave of absence.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I had to take my medical leave, I had no idea what was happening,\u201d said Monica. \u201cI thought I might be kicked out of school because when you take a mental health leave, you think, \u2018Do they even want me back?\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c[That] made me freak out and clamp down even more,\u201d she added. \u201cThings were bad when I started in Abu Dhabi, but they were much worse when I left Abu Dhabi. I basically stopped eating.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At some point while she was away, however, a combination of things made her aware of the dark side of anorexia and nurtured a desire to overcome it. Part of it was having a psychiatrist to push her, and another part was seeing middle-aged women who had never overcome their disordered eating.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest pushes, though, was when she realized that she faced spending the summer in an eating disorder rehabilitation facility instead of interning in New York. Suddenly, anorexia was coming in direct and tangible conflict with her future.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou thought this whole time that you have been reestablishing control over your life and that you are being productive, you can see your achievements on your body,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you realize and you\u2019re like \u2018Oh shit, I\u2019ve kind of fucked up.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Recovering hasn\u2019t been easy though, she said, and it is still something that she struggles with.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, I don\u2019t know when that mind-set is going to change \u2026 It\u2019s been eleven years of this disease crawling on me and telling me that the only end goal is to starve. It\u2019s basically realigning your priorities in life,\u201d she said. \u201cRecovery for me, and I think this is true for a lot of people, is rediscovering the things you value in yourself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Women have a duty to each other, Monica argued, to steer the conversation away from how we measure ourselves aesthetically.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWomen need to support each other more,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that all this crash dieting and juicing is a slippery slope into eating disorders, but at the peak of my anorexia, I was unknowingly doing all the things that women\u2019s magazines tell girls they\u2019ll need to do to be \u2018healthy.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<h3>MEDIA AND SOCIAL STANDARDS</h3>  \n\n<p>Junior Emma Leathley echoed similar sentiments about the role of media and societal standards in fostering disordered eating. She was diagnosed with anorexia in high school and eventually hospitalized for it. At the height of her eating disorder, she didn\u2019t think that she was affected by societal ideals of success and body image. Her opinion about the effects of such standards, however, has changed over time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI perceived myself as the complete opposite of being some girl who [cared about societal pressures], I perceived myself as being more powerful and somehow better than people who fall into being victimized by those standards,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think that at the end of the day, no matter how different I felt from other girls about not following those standards \u2026 some combination of that standard is always lurking in the background for everyone.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As such, Leathley said that she thinks psychiatrists and doctors do not actually get to the root of the problem. They can only mitigate the physical effects of an eating disorder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that [some individuals] are so success-driven that they want to force themselves into a version of what everyone says is success: in addition to being smart and academic, also being skinny and pretty,\u201d she explained.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I think that this is a much bigger issue than the one that the psychologists deal with. If you get rid of that, then eating disorders will go away for the most part,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Leathley also suggested that support needs to come from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf girls would have some sort of group awareness about this type of issue, including the very pervasive set of standards that we are raised not to see, then it would help girls\u2019 health in a range of ways and not just with eating,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<h3>SUPPORT AT NYUAD</h3>  \n\n<p>In terms of institution support at NYUAD, the director of the Health and Wellness Center Dr. Halah Ibrahim encouraged students to use the resources that are available.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to start these kinds of conversations,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that disordered eating is a problem here, but it exists here like it exists everywhere \u2026 People should know that there are resources out there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She mentioned the two counselors who currently work at H&amp;W and noted the 24-hour access to counselors in New York via phone or video call.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne of my priorities as the new director is to increase counseling services,\u201d Ibrahim added. \u201cAs the student population grows, Health and Wellness as a whole will also grow to be able to meet the student\u2019s needs \u2026 We\u2019re actively recruiting counselors.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She said that, if all goes according to plan, more counselors will be available by the beginning of next semester and that there is talk of collaborating with the Fitness Center to bring in a nutritionist.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond counseling and physicians, Dr. Ibrahim also mentioned the work done by the peer-support group REACH.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTina [Wadhwa] heads the Mental Health office and she is running a workshop with REACH in early May that talks about disordered eating, in addition to other things,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Annam\u00e1ria Balogh, who is organizing the May 10 talk, described it in more detail.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe event is not only going to be about eating disorders but an event about how to help a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to solve the other person\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s about being there and listening.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Balogh mentioned the other issues that will be discussed, such as anxiety, eating disorders, depression and identity formation, that the organizers of REACH think are relevant and worth talking about.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think having an open dialogue about these things is basically the first step,\u201d said Balogh. \u201cIf you live in a community where people experience different kinds of problems, I think the first thing to do is to educate people so that they are knowledgeable about these problems and can be supportive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>Clare Hennig is managing editor.

We\u2019ve all heard the shocking statistics that tout tobacco use as the top contributor to preventable death and disease. Even with all of the peer-reviewed and validated research on the harms of tobacco in all of its many forms, we have yet to make strides in smoking cessation on a global scale. As two current medical students, we are inundated daily with the importance of obtaining an accurate social history, making sure to document any use of tobacco, and, if necessary, employ motivational interviewing skills to assess our patient\u2019s desire to quit smoking.</p>\n\n<p>We are going into the business of ensuring that people live long and healthy lives, and a large part of that equation is preventing future illness. Central to preventative medicine is modifying behavior. Behavior is the hardest to change and influence as a health professional, yet it contributes more to your health outcomes than the quality of healthcare you receive, the environment in which you live, or even your genetics.</p>\n\n<p>When thinking about possible capstone projects, we knew that these health behaviors were something that we would like to tackle, especially with the rise of unhealthy lifestyle trends in the UAE as evinced by the sharp rise in obesity, heart disease and type II diabetes. Just over 19 percent of the population has type II diabetes, which is usually associated with poor dietary and physical activity standards. Research also shows the alarming rise of tobacco use among the country\u2019s youth. In one study, 12 percent of males aged 13 to 15 responded as current cigarette smokers. This is alarming; many behavioral experts agree that the teenage years are extremely formative in terms of the habits that we will carry into and reinforce in late adolescence and beyond. If we were to design an intervention to positively influence health behaviors, it would make sense to target a cohort in their teens.</p>\n\n<p>As we discussed what a possible intervention to address these trends would look like, we couldn\u2019t help but think that our experience as health educators in inner-city schools in the boroughs of New York could be manipulated to fit the cultural context of Abu Dhabi. An important aspect of this intervention would be the peer-to-peer aspect of its implementation. Our time volunteering in New York and numerous research studies from the United States and the United Kingdom convinced us that the efficacy of health education was amplified when peers were teaching it. We designed and implemented a workshop on tobacco in several private secondary schools within Abu Dhabi, along with a pre and post-survey to assess its efficacy.</p>\n\n<p>This cohort was challenging in many ways, as we hoped not only to equip them with knowledge to make informed decisions about their health but also to confront respectfully the cultural norms that surround many forms of tobacco in the Middle East. For many of our students, tobacco use was something they positively associated with friends and family. As such, we decided to focus on empowering our students to care about their health and to speak out. The impacts of tobacco use on health are serious enough that no cultural norm or familial dynamic should keep anyone silent. In the classroom, the students were engaged, curious and, at times, shocked by the information we synthesized from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.</p>\n\n<p>But what did the survey data reveal? First, that a large percentage of the teens involved in our study were already experimenting with tobacco. Over 39 percent of the males we surveyed had tried shisha between the ages of 12 and 13. Other findings included signs of possible underlying eating disorders, insufficient levels of physical activity and several misconceptions regarding tobacco use, namely shisha and dokha. Many were under the assumption that shisha, for example, was less harmful to their health than cigarette smoking; current scientific research disputes that commonly held notion.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, these students were not in the optimal position to form habits to support lifelong health. Our survey analysis showed that our peer health model was an effective intervention for changing knowledge, attitudes and perspectives on tobacco use in the UAE. Our results call attention to an important educational gap in the UAE. Health education is not an integrated part of the schooling system, and it has been proven to play a valuable role in the lives of teenagers in this cultural setting. If it was effective for tobacco use, imagine how much more preventive impact we might have if schools were to expand to a comprehensive health curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a generation of people that do not like to be told what to do. How often has a health professional told you to eat healthier, be more physically active or consider tobacco cessation? If we fail to empower people with the knowledge and skills to make healthy decisions at an early age, then the knee-jerk, scripted health advice will not make meaningful changes. It is tempting, and perhaps human nature, to avoid or procrastinate addressing the behaviors we engage in that are detrimental to our health. The consequences seem far away \u2014 an easily ignored outcome that is more likely to happen to someone else. Some people cling to anecdotes of others who have adopted these behaviors their whole lives without any health-related repercussions.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone is as fortunate, though. The number of patients with a tobacco-related condition continues to climb and increasingly strain the healthcare system. The stories are devastating because they are preventable. However difficult it may be, the push for preventative measures is more important now than ever before. The WHO estimates that around 6 million people die each year from tobacco use. That number is so large that it can be hard to appreciate, but it\u2019s still is something that we should all be concerned about. With small but effective programs like the one we conducted in only a handful of high schools, we can build toward a more wholesome and healthy future by affecting health behaviors before they become a problem.</p>\n\n<p><em>Leena Asfour and Zachary Stanley are second-year medical students in the United States.

We\u2019ve all heard the shocking statistics that tout tobacco use as the top contributor to preventable death and disease. Even with all of the peer-reviewed and validated research on the harms of tobacco in all of its many forms, we have yet to make strides in smoking cessation on a global scale. As two current medical students, we are inundated daily with the importance of obtaining an accurate social history, making sure to document any use of tobacco, and, if necessary, employ motivational interviewing skills to assess our patient\u2019s desire to quit smoking.\n\nWe are going into the business of ensuring that people live long and healthy lives, and a large part of that equation is preventing future illness. Central to preventative medicine is modifying behavior. Behavior is the hardest to change and influence as a health professional, yet it contributes more to your health outcomes than the quality of healthcare you receive, the environment in which you live, or even your genetics.\n\nWhen thinking about possible capstone projects, we knew that these health behaviors were something that we would like to tackle, especially with the rise of unhealthy lifestyle trends in the UAE as evinced by the sharp rise in obesity, heart disease and type II diabetes. Just over 19 percent of the population has type II diabetes, which is usually associated with poor dietary and physical activity standards. Research also shows the alarming rise of tobacco use among the country\u2019s youth. In one study, 12 percent of males aged 13 to 15 responded as current cigarette smokers. This is alarming; many behavioral experts agree that the teenage years are extremely formative in terms of the habits that we will carry into and reinforce in late adolescence and beyond. If we were to design an intervention to positively influence health behaviors, it would make sense to target a cohort in their teens.\n\nAs we discussed what a possible intervention to address these trends would look like, we couldn\u2019t help but think that our experience as health educators in inner-city schools in the boroughs of New York could be manipulated to fit the cultural context of Abu Dhabi. An important aspect of this intervention would be the peer-to-peer aspect of its implementation. Our time volunteering in New York and numerous research studies from the United States and the United Kingdom convinced us that the efficacy of health education was amplified when peers were teaching it. We designed and implemented a workshop on tobacco in several private secondary schools within Abu Dhabi, along with a pre and post-survey to assess its efficacy.\n\nThis cohort was challenging in many ways, as we hoped not only to equip them with knowledge to make informed decisions about their health but also to confront respectfully the cultural norms that surround many forms of tobacco in the Middle East. For many of our students, tobacco use was something they positively associated with friends and family. As such, we decided to focus on empowering our students to care about their health and to speak out. The impacts of tobacco use on health are serious enough that no cultural norm or familial dynamic should keep anyone silent. In the classroom, the students were engaged, curious and, at times, shocked by the information we synthesized from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nBut what did the survey data reveal? First, that a large percentage of the teens involved in our study were already experimenting with tobacco. Over 39 percent of the males we surveyed had tried shisha between the ages of 12 and 13. Other findings included signs of possible underlying eating disorders, insufficient levels of physical activity and several misconceptions regarding tobacco use, namely shisha and dokha. Many were under the assumption that shisha, for example, was less harmful to their health than cigarette smoking; current scientific research disputes that commonly held notion.\n\nPut simply, these students were not in the optimal position to form habits to support lifelong health. Our survey analysis showed that our peer health model was an effective intervention for changing knowledge, attitudes and perspectives on tobacco use in the UAE. Our results call attention to an important educational gap in the UAE. Health education is not an integrated part of the schooling system, and it has been proven to play a valuable role in the lives of teenagers in this cultural setting. If it was effective for tobacco use, imagine how much more preventive impact we might have if schools were to expand to a comprehensive health curriculum.\n\nWe live in a generation of people that do not like to be told what to do. How often has a health professional told you to eat healthier, be more physically active or consider tobacco cessation? If we fail to empower people with the knowledge and skills to make healthy decisions at an early age, then the knee-jerk, scripted health advice will not make meaningful changes. It is tempting, and perhaps human nature, to avoid or procrastinate addressing the behaviors we engage in that are detrimental to our health. The consequences seem far away \u2014 an easily ignored outcome that is more likely to happen to someone else. Some people cling to anecdotes of others who have adopted these behaviors their whole lives without any health-related repercussions.\n\nNot everyone is as fortunate, though. The number of patients with a tobacco-related condition continues to climb and increasingly strain the healthcare system. The stories are devastating because they are preventable. However difficult it may be, the push for preventative measures is more important now than ever before. The WHO estimates that around 6 million people die each year from tobacco use. That number is so large that it can be hard to appreciate, but it\u2019s still is something that we should all be concerned about. With small but effective programs like the one we conducted in only a handful of high schools, we can build toward a more wholesome and healthy future by affecting health behaviors before they become a problem.\n\n<em>Leena Asfour and Zachary Stanley are second-year medical students in the United States.

I knew it was going to be hard. I didn\u2019t know why, but everyone said so, and majority rules. As I now watch my younger sister near her 14th birthday, I understand the widespread belief that 14 is a hard year: boys, hormones and mean girls. I wish with all my heart that that is as hard as it gets for my baby sister. My 14 was a little bit harder.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t remember exactly how it happened, or why I knew to notice such a thing, but a few months after my 14th birthday I noticed a lump close to my armpit. Lump, in my mind, equaled cancer, or the possibility of cancer, so I told my mom. My mom told my dad, my dad told his aunt, his aunt told her oncologist. A couple of days later I went to visit the oncologist right after dinner at my grandparents\u2019 house.</p>\n\n<p>He made small talk with my mom, told me about the new school his daughter moved to and inquired after my dad\u2019s aunt\u2019s health. He then led me into a small room as my mom waited outside \u2014 she didn\u2019t think it was anything significant. A couple of minutes later I put on my shirt and followed him outside, all the while thinking how white the room was and how uncomfortable it made me feel. I was not scared, though. I was resigned, annoyed and slightly cold, but not scared. The oncologist sat down at his desk, looked at my mom and told her we would have to do some more tests because \u201cit could be\u201d or \u201cit might be.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I cannot remember my mom\u2019s immediate reaction, but knowing her she probably tried to keep her composure for my sake. I remember my reaction, though. All I could think was, \u201cWhat about my family? What would happen to them if I died? How would my sister feel? Would my parents be okay?\u201d I wasn\u2019t scared or worried by the idea of my death. I just did not want them to go through the pain of losing a daughter or a sister. I also knew I did not want to go through chemo; I saw my dad\u2019s cousin-in-law go through the same treatment and I saw how it affected her last days. I didn\u2019t want that. I wanted to spend every last moment I had being fully myself. Perhaps I was being na\u00efve, perhaps that was my own brand of shock, but my 14-year-old self knew what she wanted and was willing to stick with it.</p>\n\n<p>It was a hard time for the whole family. My mom and dad breathed prayers, hoping to God that it was benign. My dad was different, not his smiling, joking, usually loud self. I have never seen him like that since then. My sister was only seven, but even she knew something was wrong, even she was worried. My mom lost her optimism, but stayed calm and composed for me. Looking back at that time between the first and the last doctor\u2019s visit, it feels like it had been months on end, but in reality, it was probably three or four weeks at most.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing their worry even before any results came out intensified my own worry; I thought and thought and still could not come up with any way to make this easier on them. What do you do when you don\u2019t want to put those you love through pain, but know you might end up doing it anyway? Isn\u2019t it better to just do it quicker? I was not considering suicide, but I truly thought refusing treatment would put them through less trauma. I planned to tell them the moment we got the results \u2014 I didn\u2019t think there was any hope it was going to be benign. I later found out that my cousin and best friend, who had been living abroad at the time, also knew about \u201cthe lump.\u201d She told me afterwards how she sat in her room, Googling cancer, lumps and chemotherapy, how she cried. How I would have cried had I known she was also worrying.</p>\n\n<p>When the time came to find out the results, we all went to the doctor. I have never felt the amount of fear I felt then again, not when I later realized I had been in a car-crash, not when I thought the plane I was on was catching fire, not when I was on a rooftop during the revolution in Egypt, watching out for men with machine guns who might attack at any given moment. I have never been as scared as I was then because my fear was totally and absolutely focused on my loved ones. Me, I can control, I can work on. But the thought that their lives could be so severely disturbed because of me was so terrifying, it still brings me to tears.</p>\n\n<p>The moment the four of us walked into his office, the doctor informed us that the lump was benign. \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. I could see the elation, relief and tears in my parents eyes, the joy in my sister\u2019s, and it made me happier than the news itself. The rest of the conversation is a blur to me, but my parents later explained, in very unscientific terms, that due to my family history it may be that I am more susceptible to cancer than most, and so every lump presents a danger. Every lump must be examined, assessed and if we think for one second that \u201cit might be,\u201d we should make our way back to that white room.</p>\n\n<p>The two or three times a year I have found a lump since then, I consider checking it out on my own first, not informing them, not putting them through that pain. But I always end up telling them. I always tell them because no matter how much I don\u2019t really care what happens to me, I still care about having them next to me as it happens. Even if the idea of dying in a few months does not scare me, I still want them next to me so that I am able to process the news. As much as I wish that they never have to go through pain and worry, I still find myself selfish enough to inform them, worry them, every time. And every time, they have worried over something that \u201cisn\u2019t.\u201d Alhamdulilah.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mariam El Zoghbi is a contributing writer. Email her at feedback@thegazelle.org.</em></p>",

It\u2019s crazy.</p>\n\n<p>It took me a while to understand why the university needed so many gyms, but the answer hit me one day as I was trudging back to my suite after P.E., dragging myself up the Campus Center stairs. My epiphany was this: the gyms, and the mandatory P.E. requirements, are mere distractions. They are nothing but tiny cogs in a much larger wheel of what I like to refer to as Enforced Health, a.k.a.

I spend at least four hours a day climbing up stuff, and even more time trying to catch my breath after climbing up said stuff. The stairs around campus should have their own pit stops, with people in white t-shirts who hand out water bottles and glucose, cheering me on with free aromatic massages.

I live in constant dread that I will someday fall through the giant holes between the steps. I\u2019m nowhere near slim enough for that to happen, of course, but maybe if I climb enough stairs, someday I will be. And when that happens I\u2019ll fall through the gaps and land in our Olympic-sized pool when it's in the middle of an Aqua Zumba lesson, which would be horrible because I can\u2019t dance.

Jokes are made about 13-minute naps and snoozing during day because lack of sleep at normal hours is a badge of honor, testament to the hard miles pulled at night. \u201cLook at my work ethic,\u201d we subconsciously scream. \u201cI work so much harder than you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The ultra-competitive environment at NYUAD contributes to the pressure to reduce hours spent sleeping and increase hours camped out in the library, before it hits midnight and students begin the collective migration to the private ARC rooms. Our instinctive response to \u201cHow are you?\u201d is no longer, \u201cGood,\u201d but a begrudging, \u201cTired,\u201d that alludes to all the work we\u2019ve been doing.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for the workaholics, a regular sleep schedule is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle. The negative effects that sleep deprivation have on your body are not immediately noticeable, but are hugely damaging in the long run to all aspects of your wellbeing.</p>\n\n<h3>Mental</h3>\n\n<p>The most common reason for forgoing sleep is to cram in work that wasn\u2019t done during the day. Whether this is due to other commitments or simply procrastination, it\u2019s easy to find ourselves awake at 4 a.m., wishing we had started earlier. In these situations, sleep becomes a luxury, one that is easily neglected because of other priorities. The truth is that sleep should always be a top priority.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, sleep deprivation does far more to harm productivity than boost it by working through the night. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/health/23iht-snsleep.1.8015084.html\">Studies conducted</a> show participants who slept after studying a simple task were able to perform much better, suggesting that sleep helps to refresh and store memory and increase brain function. The sleeping brain has the ability to comb through information and sort it into categories for ease of access. This means that pulling an all-nighter before an exam is actually harmful to information retention; the best thing you can do the night before is simply sleep.</p>\n\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n\n<p>The physical detriments of sleep deprivation are so varied and numerous that it would be impossible to touch on all of them in a single article. A sustained lack of sleep makes you much more susceptible to stroke risk, obesity, diabetes risk, osteoporosis and cancer risk, among many others.</p>\n\n<p>Of particular concern to college students however, is sleep\u2019s effect on metabolism and exercise. Reduced sleep triggers your appetite <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120118111740.htm\">more</a> in response to pictures of food, meaning that you\u2019re more likely to overeat and binge on unhealthy foods. A few nights of bad sleep is enough to start slowing down your metabolism as insulin production reduces. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/15/science/la-sci-sn-lack-of-sleep-can-seriously-impact-metabolism-20121015\">Studies</a> show that adults who slept for only four hours four nights in a row had insulin levels equal to those of obese and diabetic people, and it took three times more insulin to process the same amount of sugar. A lack of sleep also takes a hit to your energy levels, making you unmotivated to exercise. This means that sustained sleep deprivation is likely to lead to rapid weight gain. To those avoiding the Freshman 15: your bed is your new best friend.</p>\n\n<h3>Emotional</h3>\n\n<p>Strong links have been found between sleep deprivation and emotional instability. Parts of the brain in control of emotions are <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-10/cp-sca101707.php\">overactive</a> after skipping a night of sleep, meaning that we are likely to react much more strongly when tired. People who were shown negative images after being kept awake for 35 hours were found to have 60 percent more activity in the emotional centers of the brain.</p>\n\n<p>Being sleep deprived reverts the brain back to its most primitive state and we lose restraint in our actions towards others.

Jokes are made about 13-minute naps and snoozing during day because lack of sleep at normal hours is a badge of honor, testament to the hard miles pulled at night. \u201cLook at my work ethic,\u201d we subconsciously scream. \u201cI work so much harder than you.\u201d\n\nThe ultra-competitive environment at NYUAD contributes to the pressure to reduce hours spent sleeping and increase hours camped out in the library, before it hits midnight and students begin the collective migration to the private ARC rooms. Our instinctive response to \u201cHow are you?\u201d is no longer, \u201cGood,\u201d but a begrudging, \u201cTired,\u201d that alludes to all the work we\u2019ve been doing.\n\nUnfortunately for the workaholics, a regular sleep schedule is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle. The negative effects that sleep deprivation have on your body are not immediately noticeable, but are hugely damaging in the long run to all aspects of your wellbeing.\n\n<h3>Mental</h3>\n\nThe most common reason for forgoing sleep is to cram in work that wasn\u2019t done during the day. Whether this is due to other commitments or simply procrastination, it\u2019s easy to find ourselves awake at 4 a.m., wishing we had started earlier. In these situations, sleep becomes a luxury, one that is easily neglected because of other priorities. The truth is that sleep should always be a top priority.\n\nIn reality, sleep deprivation does far more to harm productivity than boost it by working through the night. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/health/23iht-snsleep.1.8015084.html\">Studies conducted</a> show participants who slept after studying a simple task were able to perform much better, suggesting that sleep helps to refresh and store memory and increase brain function. The sleeping brain has the ability to comb through information and sort it into categories for ease of access. This means that pulling an all-nighter before an exam is actually harmful to information retention; the best thing you can do the night before is simply sleep.\n\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n\nThe physical detriments of sleep deprivation are so varied and numerous that it would be impossible to touch on all of them in a single article. A sustained lack of sleep makes you much more susceptible to stroke risk, obesity, diabetes risk, osteoporosis and cancer risk, among many others.\n\nOf particular concern to college students however, is sleep\u2019s effect on metabolism and exercise. Reduced sleep triggers your appetite <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120118111740.htm\">more</a> in response to pictures of food, meaning that you\u2019re more likely to overeat and binge on unhealthy foods. A few nights of bad sleep is enough to start slowing down your metabolism as insulin production reduces. \n\n<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/15/science/la-sci-sn-lack-of-sleep-can-seriously-impact-metabolism-20121015\">Studies</a> show that adults who slept for only four hours four nights in a row had insulin levels equal to those of obese and diabetic people, and it took three times more insulin to process the same amount of sugar. A lack of sleep also takes a hit to your energy levels, making you unmotivated to exercise. This means that sustained sleep deprivation is likely to lead to rapid weight gain. To those avoiding the Freshman 15: your bed is your new best friend.\n\n<h3>Emotional</h3>\n\nStrong links have been found between sleep deprivation and emotional instability. Parts of the brain in control of emotions are <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-10/cp-sca101707.php\">overactive</a> after skipping a night of sleep, meaning that we are likely to react much more strongly when tired. People who were shown negative images after being kept awake for 35 hours were found to have 60 percent more activity in the emotional centers of the brain.\n\nBeing sleep deprived reverts the brain back to its most primitive state and we lose restraint in our actions towards others. When we are constantly surrounded by people, this has the potential to wreak havoc on our relationships. From freaking out over your roommate\u2019s dirty dishes to snapping at your professors, loss of control over your emotions has its consequences. Not only this, but being in a tumultuous emotional state can make you unmotivated and take its toll on your grades in the long run.\n\nLack of sleep shouldn\u2019t be a competition, nor should it be testament to how deserving we each are of being at this school. The consequences of sleep deprivation are hugely damaging to your grades, physical health and relationships in the long run; it simply isn\u2019t worth procrastinating during the day just to work through the entire night. Those sleepless nights will add up fast, which is why it\u2019s of the utmost importance to fall into a regular sleeping schedule while we\u2019re young. Your body will thank you.\n\n<em>Penelope Peng is deputy news editor. Email her at feedback@thegazelle.org.</em>",

The pieces featured a variety of personal topics \u2014 ranging from first experiences to ethnic and cultural identities and personal relationships \u2014 which, in my defense, made each particularly moving.</p>\n\n<p>However, the one that made me burst into tears was not about summer love, family issues or body image. It was simply a story about one of my classmates' distressing memory of being physically and verbally abused throughout their childhood by a peer at school. The monologue described in full detail a scene in which the aggressor approached the actor before class and publicly confronted them with humiliating insults and physical violence, cruelly breaking some of their school material in front of all their classmates.</p>\n\n<p>Bullying is a very sensitive topic for me, even today. Having experienced physical and verbal abuse by some of my classmates all throughout preschool and primary school, I wasn\u2019t able to watch the monologue without each word opening up old wounds that I had previously thought of as healed. Every sentence revived painful images from the past that sped up my heart and tensed my throat in seconds \u2014 just as the reality I lived in my village in southern Spain managed to do several times a day since I was six years old until I was able to leave my school.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, I was reminded of my most distressing experience with bullying, which happened on my 12th birthday. After deciding to leave the school where I spent the most unhappy years of my life, I invited my classmates to my birthday party in an attempt to make peace. Expecting this to be a nice closure with my peers, I asked my mother to buy a cake for all of us, and in an attempt to showcase maturity, I asked her to give it to me and leave so that I would appear to be in charge during the party. We had planned to meet later, so she could help me carry the gifts home in the car. I will probably never forget what happened after she hugged me and drove away.</p>\n\n<p>As I stood with my peace cake waiting for my peers, I heard someone approaching me hastily from behind. A second after, I remember being covered \u2014 both my cake and me \u2014 by some sort of dirty water mixed with mud that had been thrown at me by some of the peers I had been waiting for. Their cruel laughter died off in the distance as they ran away, and I felt the highest level of humiliation I have ever experienced. That walk home on my 12th birthday, alone, covered in mud and shame, while trying to think of something to tell my parents to make them believe I actually had friends, was probably the hardest one I have ever walked.</p>\n\n<p>In seconds, the images drilled through the cement layers I had built to separate such a traumatic part of my past from my present, until they reached my most vulnerable spot. And while my class started analyzing my classmate\u2019s monologue, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a mixture of shame and relief as I wiped away my tears.</p>\n\n<p>Shame, because in a community built upon expected success, vulnerability of any kind is never acceptable, even if it stems from a past we have since left behind. Relief, because that had just been the first time in my life hearing someone else talk openly, emotionally, genuinely and in front of other people, about their experience being bullied.</p>\n\n<p>When one thinks about it, that's kind of strange. Considering that I have had able ears for the past 20 years \u2014 and have listened attentively for the word \u201cbullying\u201d for the past 14 \u2014 and that in the U.S. alone, <a href=\"http://www.stopbullying.gov/news/media/facts/#listing\">more than 20</a> percent of children reportedly suffer from bullying, it is almost incomprehensible that there has been so little conversation on this topic among my community. Despite the fact that I have generally lived in very supportive environments since coming to NYUAD, I have never had the chance to discuss the topic in full honesty and emotional scope, let alone with confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I felt that until that moment \u2014 unintentionally or otherwise \u2014 I had been exposed to institutional and social expectations to perform well and to seem confident, happy and secure. The image of a broken childhood did not seem to fit in such narrative; so I decided to bury it deep, next to the memories of shitty breakups and the story of the day I forgot to lock the door of a public toilet, and pretend that I could move on without closure. This, of course, led me to believe that I was the only person in my community who had dealt with such issues, which only made my bullies' insults about the abnormality of my personality feel all the more true.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, this temporary belief due to the lack of conversation on bullying didn\u2019t cause much of a lasting effect on me, except for some confidence issues that I overcame a few years later. But often, this isn\u2019t the case for a number of bullying victims. Many <a href=\"http://nobullying.com/bullying-suicide-statistics/\">studies</a> show strong relationships between bullying and depression, academic failure, anxiety, changes in eating patterns and suicide. In fact, in the U.K. alone, <a href=\"http://nobullying.com/bullying-suicide-statistics/\">half</a> of the suicide cases among young people are connected to bullying.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, not only is silence and lack of awareness on bullying detrimental to victims, but it is also destructive to bullies themselves. Youth involved in physical and verbal abuse \u2014 who may find their motivations rooted in psychological insecurities or social pressures \u2014 are also more likely to fail academically, develop abusive relationships, have other criminal convictions and abuse drugs-related substances as adults.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I know that the line isn\u2019t that easily drawn between bullied and bully. I have been both at different stages in life. Bullying is a struggle for power, which some would say is part of life, and in different contexts we can all manage to shift the balance from one side to the other \u2014 for example, <span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">when I react with pretentious surprise to someone's ignorance on any topic I consider essential \u2014e.g. Almodovar \u2014 I'm also, in my own way, engaging in the power struggle game.</span> In fact, from what I have seen, I would argue that people who have been on the losing side of the balance might try to overcompensate in later life stages and abusively gain their power back. However, the real danger comes when one side is able to completely dominate and crush the other, as it happens when the parties involved are only children or teenagers.</p>\n\n<p>I believe there needs to be more awareness about the social phenomenon of bullying. It is only through openness of this issue that victims can normalize their experience and reconcile themselves with their past, as well as support others who are currently going through psychological difficulties due to having been abused. It is my hope that taboos on bullying \u2014 or any other form of vulnerability that is currently hidden from public conversation \u2014 will eventually be erased. In this way those suffering from bullying can seek help at an early stage, and those standing by can feel empowered to stop bullying at the first sign.</p>\n\n<p>One day, after I finally shed most of my complexes and insecurities from being bullied, someone back in Spain told me that I should be thankful for the experience, as it let me become the kind of person I am today. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d I responded at that moment. But after thinking about it, I realized maybe they were right. Maybe going through such hardships has made me a stronger person in other realms, and maybe that is a good thing.

The pieces featured a variety of personal topics \u2014 ranging from first experiences to ethnic and cultural identities and personal relationships \u2014 which, in my defense, made each particularly moving.\n\nHowever, the one that made me burst into tears was not about summer love, family issues or body image. It was simply a story about one of my classmates' distressing memory of being physically and verbally abused throughout their childhood by a peer at school. The monologue described in full detail a scene in which the aggressor approached the actor before class and publicly confronted them with humiliating insults and physical violence, cruelly breaking some of their school material in front of all their classmates.\n\nBullying is a very sensitive topic for me, even today. Having experienced physical and verbal abuse by some of my classmates all throughout preschool and primary school, I wasn\u2019t able to watch the monologue without each word opening up old wounds that I had previously thought of as healed. Every sentence revived painful images from the past that sped up my heart and tensed my throat in seconds \u2014 just as the reality I lived in my village in southern Spain managed to do several times a day since I was six years old until I was able to leave my school.\n\nIn particular, I was reminded of my most distressing experience with bullying, which happened on my 12th birthday. After deciding to leave the school where I spent the most unhappy years of my life, I invited my classmates to my birthday party in an attempt to make peace. Expecting this to be a nice closure with my peers, I asked my mother to buy a cake for all of us, and in an attempt to showcase maturity, I asked her to give it to me and leave so that I would appear to be in charge during the party. We had planned to meet later, so she could help me carry the gifts home in the car. I will probably never forget what happened after she hugged me and drove away.\n\nAs I stood with my peace cake waiting for my peers, I heard someone approaching me hastily from behind. A second after, I remember being covered \u2014 both my cake and me \u2014 by some sort of dirty water mixed with mud that had been thrown at me by some of the peers I had been waiting for. Their cruel laughter died off in the distance as they ran away, and I felt the highest level of humiliation I have ever experienced. That walk home on my 12th birthday, alone, covered in mud and shame, while trying to think of something to tell my parents to make them believe I actually had friends, was probably the hardest one I have ever walked.\n\nIn seconds, the images drilled through the cement layers I had built to separate such a traumatic part of my past from my present, until they reached my most vulnerable spot. And while my class started analyzing my classmate\u2019s monologue, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a mixture of shame and relief as I wiped away my tears.\n\nShame, because in a community built upon expected success, vulnerability of any kind is never acceptable, even if it stems from a past we have since left behind. Relief, because that had just been the first time in my life hearing someone else talk openly, emotionally, genuinely and in front of other people, about their experience being bullied.\n\nWhen one thinks about it, that's kind of strange. Considering that I have had able ears for the past 20 years \u2014 and have listened attentively for the word \u201cbullying\u201d for the past 14 \u2014 and that in the U.S. alone, <a href=\"http://www.stopbullying.gov/news/media/facts/#listing\">more than 20</a> percent of children reportedly suffer from bullying, it is almost incomprehensible that there has been so little conversation on this topic among my community. Despite the fact that I have generally lived in very supportive environments since coming to NYUAD, I have never had the chance to discuss the topic in full honesty and emotional scope, let alone with confidence.\n\nInstead, I felt that until that moment \u2014 unintentionally or otherwise \u2014 I had been exposed to institutional and social expectations to perform well and to seem confident, happy and secure. The image of a broken childhood did not seem to fit in such narrative; so I decided to bury it deep, next to the memories of shitty breakups and the story of the day I forgot to lock the door of a public toilet, and pretend that I could move on without closure. This, of course, led me to believe that I was the only person in my community who had dealt with such issues, which only made my bullies' insults about the abnormality of my personality feel all the more true.\n\nThankfully, this temporary belief due to the lack of conversation on bullying didn\u2019t cause much of a lasting effect on me, except for some confidence issues that I overcame a few years later. But often, this isn\u2019t the case for a number of bullying victims. Many <a href=\"http://nobullying.com/bullying-suicide-statistics/\">studies</a> show strong relationships between bullying and depression, academic failure, anxiety, changes in eating patterns and suicide. In fact, in the U.K. alone, <a href=\"http://nobullying.com/bullying-suicide-statistics/\">half</a> of the suicide cases among young people are connected to bullying.\n\nMoreover, not only is silence and lack of awareness on bullying detrimental to victims, but it is also destructive to bullies themselves. Youth involved in physical and verbal abuse \u2014 who may find their motivations rooted in psychological insecurities or social pressures \u2014 are also more likely to fail academically, develop abusive relationships, have other criminal convictions and abuse drugs-related substances as adults.\n\nToday, I know that the line isn\u2019t that easily drawn between bullied and bully. I have been both at different stages in life. Bullying is a struggle for power, which some would say is part of life, and in different contexts we can all manage to shift the balance from one side to the other \u2014 for example, <span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">when I react with pretentious surprise to someone's ignorance on any topic I consider essential \u2014e.g. Almodovar \u2014 I'm also, in my own way, engaging in the power struggle game.</span> In fact, from what I have seen, I would argue that people who have been on the losing side of the balance might try to overcompensate in later life stages and abusively gain their power back. However, the real danger comes when one side is able to completely dominate and crush the other, as it happens when the parties involved are only children or teenagers.\n\nI believe there needs to be more awareness about the social phenomenon of bullying. It is only through openness of this issue that victims can normalize their experience and reconcile themselves with their past, as well as support others who are currently going through psychological difficulties due to having been abused. It is my hope that taboos on bullying \u2014 or any other form of vulnerability that is currently hidden from public conversation \u2014 will eventually be erased. In this way those suffering from bullying can seek help at an early stage, and those standing by can feel empowered to stop bullying at the first sign.\n\nOne day, after I finally shed most of my complexes and insecurities from being bullied, someone back in Spain told me that I should be thankful for the experience, as it let me become the kind of person I am today. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d I responded at that moment. But after thinking about it, I realized maybe they were right. Maybe going through such hardships has made me a stronger person in other realms, and maybe that is a good thing. I feel that after ten years, I have become the kind of person I want to be, and I am truly happy with the general direction my life has taken.\n\nBut I\u2019m pretty sure that, even though I am happy now with the long-term results of this experience in me, I would still have liked to have the right to choose at the time. I would have liked to know what I would have been like had I not had to put up with such treatment. I would have liked to know what the average childhood feels like, so that when I'm a father, I can know whether I'm doing it right.\n\nThankfully, after having built and rebuilt my life at three different schools and countries, I still may shed a tear or two with videos like this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75gsCJaXTnQ\">one</a>, but it\u2019s very hard for me to think of this topic as emotionally I once did.

No one in my family has much faith in Gary except for Grandma Donna: she justifies her monthly $40 visits by repeatedly invoking his 1980s\u2019 prediction that my father would marry \u201ca woman from the Orient.\u201d This story, though famous in Houk family folklore, is not so convincing for the rest of us. In reality, Gary knew that his client desperately wanted her son, 35 years old and single, to get married and have kids, and that my dad was then traveling to Japan for a business trip. Dad met my mother, a Chinese American born and raised in Manhattan, years later when his business partner introduced them. Still, that was enough to fuel my grandmother\u2019s chatter throughout my childhood about the role divination played in my parents\u2019 union and my future perfectionist temperament. </p>\n\n<p>By elementary school, evidence seemed to support Gary\u2019s claim about my so-called perfectionism. My transcript, a piece of colored paper taped to the classroom wall with my name and grades, was filled with gold stars and 12-out-of-12 scores for spelling and multiplication tests. At after-school recitals, I performed impressive piano solos, though the music I played could be better described as obedient rather than mellifluous. My instructors praised my consistently high performance, and Gary\u2019s prediction became more fact than fallacy to me. It got repeated so much, to me and by me, that for a time it shaped who I thought I was. </p>\n\n<p>As I grew older, I became increasingly familiar with the art of failure: failing farther and faster, to frame these experiences in the legacy of Elizabeth Bishop. As my mistakes and disappointments grew in number and gravity, so did my acceptance of them. They still hurt, but my mother\u2019s mantra, which she first said to me in a Metro-North train bathroom after I spilled hot chocolate on my sweater, always made me feel better. \u201cShit happens,\u201d she said, mopping my top with a wad of paper napkins. Though I was called, and believed myself to be, a motivated perfectionist throughout my childhood, it turns out I was just in an environment that valued accomplishment, even if the motivation sometimes didn\u2019t feel so healthy. I wasn\u2019t living perfectionism in the true sense of the word: as a medical disorder that pushes people to set irrationally high or irrationally important goals for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between taking pleasure in achievement and perfectionism as medical condition, which can be a burden in and of itself that inflicts feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. Even worse, perfectionism is often associated with other negative effects and conditions, such as eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, increased assessment anxiety and decreased achievement motivation and satisfaction. Studies of students and athletes even show that perfectionists underperform compared to their potential and their less anxiety-ridden peers, and they also identify opportunities for growth and feedback, such as workshops, as risks that open them up to critique and should be avoided. </p>\n\n<p>The widespread confusion between perfectionism as a throwaway phrase and perfectionism as a condition is not accidental. In fact, it stems from the medical field. Many psychologists argue that there are two types of perfectionism: adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive perfectionism refers to people who strive for healthy organization, goals and stress management, whereas maladaptive perfectionists set goals so unrealistic that their efforts result in self-criticism and low self-esteem. Some psychologists use different terminology, labeling the two types of perfectionist tendencies as normal or neurotic, active or passive, positive or negative, but these differences are largely semantic. They all propagate the belief that one type of perfectionism is good and \u201cnormal,\u201d and the other is bad and abnormal. </p>\n\n<p>Other scholars and doctors, among them Thomas Greenspon, disagree. Greenspon argues that because absolute perfection is impossible, there are no possible healthy or adaptive ways of striving towards such a goal. When people casually call themselves perfectionists \u2014 or when Gary points the finger at you \u2014 they are actually noticing typical traits of \u201cstriving for excellence.\u201d While perfectionists see flaws a personal defects, those who strive for excellence consider mistakes or imperfections as reasons to work harder. </p>\n\n<p>When Gary predicted I would be a perfectionist, he was flattering more than warning my grandmother. We\u2019ve all heard, maybe even used, the classic interview line, \u201cMy biggest weakness is that I\u2019m a perfectionist.\u201d The subtext to such a statement is that even if we spend too much time or energy on a specific task, that level of attention and care is not so bad, and perhaps even a strength. In the USA Network show Monk, the titular detective\u2019s OCD causes him to suffer but also provides him with almost superhuman powers of observance. Whenever people comment on his OCD behaviors, he replies, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift \u2014 and a curse.\u201d Perfectionism, at the least the valorized kind, is often viewed as a type of gift as well: a tool rather than an obstacle.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Chua\u2019s notorious memoir The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother unleashed a torrent of media attention on perfectionist parenting strategies, particularly employed by mothers of Chinese heritage, when it was published in 2011. Many TV personalities, scholars and parents accused her of cruelly enforcing impossibly high standards for her two daughters. One magazine columnist accused Chua of practicing \u201cabusive perfectionism,\u201d and TIME Magazine wrote that in China, \u201ccheerless demands for perfection are becoming a problem.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I agree that some of Chua\u2019s parenting tactics, such as requiring her daughter to practice the piano for up to six hours daily, seem extreme, but I also think it\u2019s easy to point to perfectionism as a problem when we view it through another cultural lens. If we call some perfectionism \u201cnormal,\u201d we recognize that some perfectionism is abnormal. Who decides where the line is drawn? Normality is a constantly evolving social construct. How can some perfectionism be lauded as normal and beneficial while simultaneously being condemned as \u201cabusive\u201d?</p>\n\n<p>I worry about myths and the glorification of perfectionism in a \u201cworld\u2019s honor college\u201d environment where every student is expected to emerge as a global leader who has completed an important research project by graduation. We are all here because of impressive transcripts, packed CVs and dogged ambition. Several times a year, such as when we apply to study abroad, overload, underload, attend graduate school, and get a job, we are reminded that we are being evaluated by a traditional and rather inflexible measurement known as a GPA. Somehow, this three-digit number tells the world if we\u2019re qualified for a certain type of experience. </p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not just that our efforts, interests, curiosities, strengths and weaknesses are flattened into a number or letter; it\u2019s also that we expect this number to be, well, perfect. I grew up with the understanding that demonstrating knowledge of 70 to 79 percent of class material is \u201caverage,\u201d or a C.  I was surprised to learn from a British professor at NYU Abu Dhabi that in the United Kingdom, 70 percent and above is considered \u201cexcellent\u201d performance. I agree with him that the UK\u2019s system is just plain better: it leaves room for significant growth while simultaneously recognizing outstanding effort and mastery of ideas. As a high school professor put it, \u201cGetting a 90 percent or above means you\u2019ve solved the topic you\u2019re addressing. People can read your essay and never write about it again.\u201d Still, we hunger for the immaculate 100, a tacit form of perfectionism. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m grateful I dodged Gary\u2019s prediction of becoming a perfectionist, and I hope that as people become increasingly aware of the real effects of perfectionism as a condition, the word loses its value as praise or a strength. But just because I am not a true perfectionist does not mean I am immune to the pressures that inundate students at schools such as NYUAD. My family and I make fun of Gary\u2019s predictions, but I cleave to my own superstitions and contradictions about fate. I maintain skepticism of full control and determination of certain situations because believing that some aspects of my life are ungovernable helps mitigate the guilt I feel when my expectations are not met. When things do go right, nodding to chance is a way of gently practicing humility. Some of my friends frame the results they get, good or bad, by saying that everything happens for a reason. But I prefer what my mother says: shit happens.</p>\n\n<p><em>Veronica Houk is a contributing writer. Email her at feedback@thegazelle.org.</em></p>",

People can read your essay and never write about it again.\u201d Still, we hunger for the immaculate 100, a tacit form of perfectionism. \n\nI\u2019m grateful I dodged Gary\u2019s prediction of becoming a perfectionist, and I hope that as people become increasingly aware of the real effects of perfectionism as a condition, the word loses its value as praise or a strength. But just because I am not a true perfectionist does not mean I am immune to the pressures that inundate students at schools such as NYUAD. My family and I make fun of Gary\u2019s predictions, but I cleave to my own superstitions and contradictions about fate. I maintain skepticism of full control and determination of certain situations because believing that some aspects of my life are ungovernable helps mitigate the guilt I feel when my expectations are not met. When things do go right, nodding to chance is a way of gently practicing humility. Some of my friends frame the results they get, good or bad, by saying that everything happens for a reason. But I prefer what my mother says: shit happens.\n\n<em>Veronica Houk is a contributing writer. Email her at feedback@thegazelle.org.</em>",
