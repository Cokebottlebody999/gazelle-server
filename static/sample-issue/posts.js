I had been working in the study room of my dorm building, trying to keep my eyes on an increasingly blurry paragraph about colonial perspectives of late 19th-century Africa. Sitting across from me was a friend who had her head down, in a nap that was probably half-intentional. It was around 12:30 a.m.</p>\n\n<p>I stood up, closed my book mid-page and decided to go to bed. The ten hours of sleep that followed were the best I\u2019d had all semester, even if they weren\u2019t entirely guilt-free.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that senior year is supposed to be stressful, that university is a time of intense study and burgeoning caffeine addiction. But as we pile on assignments and Google Calendar events, wrenching the mechanisms of our bodies into various working modes, the knowledge that fellow students are doing the same should not be comforting. Academia is about intellectual prowess and curiosity; but sometimes, while struggling to keep our eyes open for the next paragraph, the next hour, it can feel more like a test of physical endurance.</p>\n\n<p>Health in today\u2019s world is increasingly valorized and glamorized; we see it in the spreads of lifestyle magazines, in the green gleam of an Instagrammed avocado. As someone who was once spotted drinking yoghurt through a straw, I do not particularly consider myself an authority on health trends or #eatingclean. But I\u2019m glad that NYU Abu Dhabi has been encouraging students to talk about wellbeing on-campus, and that mental health is becoming a bigger part of that conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Various articles in this issue focus on one specific aspect of health, but their overall aim is to acknowledge the fact that often, mental and physical become inseparable. I realized this during a semester abroad in Morocco, after a bout of stomach illness left me suddenly sick, the sickest I\u2019d ever been in my life. A clinic trip, a couple injections and a week of rice and carrots later, I was more or less better. But there lingered an inherent discomfort with how quickly, how spectacularly and powerfully, my own digestive system had betrayed me. I had never broken a bone, never even had a cavity. The months that followed left me grappling with my relationship to my own body, one that I now felt alienated and estranged from.</p>\n\n<p>Bodies and minds have limits, weaknesses, moments of malfunction. Truly recovering from my illness began with acknowledging these boundaries and learning how to respect them. It is not just a lifestyle, but also an incredibly difficult and taxing mindset. More than anything, health means taking care of yourself. It means sometimes putting your interests before others. It means going to bed when you need to go to bed.</p>\n\n<p>The Gazelle\u2019s hope for this issue was to show the full diversity of health at NYUAD, in all its mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and interpersonal facets. It does not aim to promote certain lifestyles or ways of thinking, but rather to make visible campus efforts that have been ongoing for a while. This issue was only possible thanks to the students who opened up about their individual experiences with health and wellbeing. We hope that their stories prove helpful and inspiring, and that they can serve as landmarks for a conversation which still has a long way to go.</p>\n\n<p>[big<em>image]<a href=\"http://thegazelle.s3.amazonaws.com/gazelle/2015/10/joey.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142421\" src=\"http://thegazelle.s3.amazonaws.com/gazelle/2015/10/joey.png\" alt=\"joey\" width=\"1990\" height=\"1132\" /></a>[/big</em>image]</p>\n\n<h3>Joey</h3>  \n\n<p>I started to think that something was wrong last semester, in the spring of my junior year. It was a night that my roommate and I had carved out for studying. We had many nights like that \u2014 each sitting at her desk for hours, maybe a break for cheese and jam and then back to work until we collapsed from exhaustion. That night, at about 2 a.m., we heard somebody screaming for help.</p>\n\n<p>It isn\u2019t my place to say any more about the incident except what it taught me about myself. Without minding it, I had fallen into a very single-minded routine for work efficiency, and this incident blindsided me. Somebody I saw regularly had been in trouble and I didn\u2019t notice.</p>\n\n<p>My roommate said something that I can\u2019t forget: \u201cWe hear it this time, but think of all the people who don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I saw that my priorities were lopsided. Narrow. Selfish. Over the years at NYU Abu Dhabi, I had fine-tuned and chiseled down my focus so well on intellectual, academic and career goals. Coming back from study abroad helped me see how much sharper this focus becomes on Saadiyat Campus. The emphasis and demand are always on self-improvement \u2014 already a self-centered realm. Narrower still is that the areas of self-improvement tend to fall heavily, if not entirely, on academia and career. Perhaps that\u2019s what university is for, and I couldn\u2019t blame it for creating such an environment. I could blame myself.</p>\n\n<p>Coming out of that night, I decided that one of my goals is friendship. The same way that we set goals for classes, extra-curriculars and career, I wanted to set and work toward friendship goals. To commit time, energy and care to relationships. I\u2019m not doing it perfectly now, but I\u2019m working on it.</p>\n\n<p>It is my hope that this special issue on health will help bring to light the struggles that many of us, and many other university students, continue to confront \u2014 whether overtly or silently. Maybe it will help others come out of the same kind of narrow vision that I had. Maybe it will remind us to take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p>Joey Bui and Zo\u00eb Hu are co-editors-in-chief.

Although no such statistics exist for NYU Abu Dhabi or other universities in the region, a lack of official numbers does not mean the issue itself is non-existent. Three NYUAD students opened up to share their stories about anorexia, bulimia and recovery both on and of-campus.   </p>\n\n<h3>\u201cYOU HAVE YOUR LIFE IN YOUR OWN HANDS\u201d</h3>  \n\n<p>\u201cIn [my home country], a girl is only considered pretty if she is skinny. That just goes hand in hand,\u201d said Victoria, who asked that her real name not be used.</p>\n\n<p>Leaning back against the plush chair in my living room, fingers curled around a mug of tea, she began to tell her story of bulimia. Her eating disorder, she said, had a very clear starting point; while on holiday with her parents during a school break, she inadvertently lost a couple of pounds and enjoyed the reactions she received.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I went back to school, my peers, for some reason, had a very easy time noticing that I had lost weight and they started making comments about how good I looked,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never heard that before \u2026 and I really liked it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Victoria went home after school that day and, with the praise of her friends still echoing in her mind, decided that she didn\u2019t feel hungry. She embarked on a diet, focusing on eating healthily at first.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI lost some more weight,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I started throwing up after every meal because I realized that there were some days when I was super hungry and I was eating like I used to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Her parents must have realized what was happening, she said, when they heard her purging after meals. At one point, her mother had to take her shopping nearly every week to buy clothes in smaller and smaller sizes. Victoria appreciated that they did not directly intervene, however, but instead supported her while making the costs of continuing clear.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for all the girls and guys out there who have had an eating disorder but for me, it was about having control in my life,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cBulimia and eating disorders in general make you feel very much like you are in control. You know that almost everyone out there wants to lose weight \u2026 And when you start losing weight so rapidly, you realize that you\u2019ve got this. You have your life in your own hands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, however, Victoria felt that her bulimia was spiraling out of control. She knew it had to stop. Although she is very grateful that bulimia is no longer a part of her life, she said she wouldn\u2019t take back that period of her life if she had the chance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf I could turn back time, I wouldn\u2019t do anything differently,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cTo begin with, I don\u2019t know if I would even be here at this amazing university had it not been for bulimia and the huge jump in my GPA \u2026 and it taught me about my relationships with my friends and my parents, and with myself and my body, with academics, everything.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to recognize that, but it\u2019s not always such a bad thing. This sounds twisted and bad, but I really think so,\u201d she added.</p>\n\n<h3>DE-GLAMORIZING ANOREXIA</h3>  \n\n<p>Monica, who also requested that her name not be published, emphasized that she did not want to glamorize her eating disorder in any way.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTalking about it is so important because as long as you think it is glamorous and as long as you think you are doing the best thing for you \u2014 which you will think when you have an eating disorder \u2014 it\u2019s easy to associate eating disorders with notions of beauty or control or purity, these kind of abstract ideals that really at the core of it don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>She painted a brutal picture of what it was like to live with an eating disorder and of how bad her anorexia became for her health and well-being.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I see photos of myself then, yeah, I looked vaguely presentable with enough makeup,\u201d Monica said. \u201cBut my eyes were sallow and I looked sick. I was bruised all over. I couldn\u2019t lay on my bed because my bones were digging into me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d she added. \u201cBut until you start sharing those anecdotes with other women, you think that what we present on the street is what we are, which is not the case.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Monica and I were in the library late at night, and had wandered off to find a secluded place to talk away from the florescent lights and clacking of keyboards in the common area. We eventually settled in the back, hidden amongst a row of books, and talked for more than an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Monica told me that she had counted calories and restricted food since about the age of eleven, but her eating disorder worsened during the gap between high school and university. A lot was happening in her personal and home life at the time, and the drive she would have devoted to academics found its release in starvation and self-destructive behaviors. Starting university did not put an end to it, but only made it much worse.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe ability to be anonymous in college and to pass things off as \u2018Oh, I have too much work\u2019 \u2014 which is always the case here \u2014 it made it much easier to escalate things,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are in that mindset, it\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks before the end of her freshman year, she had to take a leave of absence.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I had to take my medical leave, I had no idea what was happening,\u201d said Monica. \u201cI thought I might be kicked out of school because when you take a mental health leave, you think, \u2018Do they even want me back?\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c[That] made me freak out and clamp down even more,\u201d she added. \u201cThings were bad when I started in Abu Dhabi, but they were much worse when I left Abu Dhabi. I basically stopped eating.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At some point while she was away, however, a combination of things made her aware of the dark side of anorexia and nurtured a desire to overcome it. Part of it was having a psychiatrist to push her, and another part was seeing middle-aged women who had never overcome their disordered eating.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest pushes, though, was when she realized that she faced spending the summer in an eating disorder rehabilitation facility instead of interning in New York. Suddenly, anorexia was coming in direct and tangible conflict with her future.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou thought this whole time that you have been reestablishing control over your life and that you are being productive, you can see your achievements on your body,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you realize and you\u2019re like \u2018Oh shit, I\u2019ve kind of fucked up.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Recovering hasn\u2019t been easy though, she said, and it is still something that she struggles with.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, I don\u2019t know when that mind-set is going to change \u2026 It\u2019s been eleven years of this disease crawling on me and telling me that the only end goal is to starve. It\u2019s basically realigning your priorities in life,\u201d she said. \u201cRecovery for me, and I think this is true for a lot of people, is rediscovering the things you value in yourself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Women have a duty to each other, Monica argued, to steer the conversation away from how we measure ourselves aesthetically.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWomen need to support each other more,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that all this crash dieting and juicing is a slippery slope into eating disorders, but at the peak of my anorexia, I was unknowingly doing all the things that women\u2019s magazines tell girls they\u2019ll need to do to be \u2018healthy.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<h3>MEDIA AND SOCIAL STANDARDS</h3>  \n\n<p>Junior Emma Leathley echoed similar sentiments about the role of media and societal standards in fostering disordered eating. She was diagnosed with anorexia in high school and eventually hospitalized for it. At the height of her eating disorder, she didn\u2019t think that she was affected by societal ideals of success and body image. Her opinion about the effects of such standards, however, has changed over time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI perceived myself as the complete opposite of being some girl who [cared about societal pressures], I perceived myself as being more powerful and somehow better than people who fall into being victimized by those standards,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think that at the end of the day, no matter how different I felt from other girls about not following those standards \u2026 some combination of that standard is always lurking in the background for everyone.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As such, Leathley said that she thinks psychiatrists and doctors do not actually get to the root of the problem. They can only mitigate the physical effects of an eating disorder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that [some individuals] are so success-driven that they want to force themselves into a version of what everyone says is success: in addition to being smart and academic, also being skinny and pretty,\u201d she explained.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I think that this is a much bigger issue than the one that the psychologists deal with. If you get rid of that, then eating disorders will go away for the most part,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Leathley also suggested that support needs to come from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf girls would have some sort of group awareness about this type of issue, including the very pervasive set of standards that we are raised not to see, then it would help girls\u2019 health in a range of ways and not just with eating,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<h3>SUPPORT AT NYUAD</h3>  \n\n<p>In terms of institution support at NYUAD, the director of the Health and Wellness Center Dr. Halah Ibrahim encouraged students to use the resources that are available.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to start these kinds of conversations,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that disordered eating is a problem here, but it exists here like it exists everywhere \u2026 People should know that there are resources out there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She mentioned the two counselors who currently work at H&amp;W and noted the 24-hour access to counselors in New York via phone or video call.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne of my priorities as the new director is to increase counseling services,\u201d Ibrahim added. \u201cAs the student population grows, Health and Wellness as a whole will also grow to be able to meet the student\u2019s needs \u2026 We\u2019re actively recruiting counselors.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She said that, if all goes according to plan, more counselors will be available by the beginning of next semester and that there is talk of collaborating with the Fitness Center to bring in a nutritionist.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond counseling and physicians, Dr. Ibrahim also mentioned the work done by the peer-support group REACH.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTina [Wadhwa] heads the Mental Health office and she is running a workshop with REACH in early May that talks about disordered eating, in addition to other things,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Annam\u00e1ria Balogh, who is organizing the May 10 talk, described it in more detail.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe event is not only going to be about eating disorders but an event about how to help a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to solve the other person\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s about being there and listening.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Balogh mentioned the other issues that will be discussed, such as anxiety, eating disorders, depression and identity formation, that the organizers of REACH think are relevant and worth talking about.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think having an open dialogue about these things is basically the first step,\u201d said Balogh. \u201cIf you live in a community where people experience different kinds of problems, I think the first thing to do is to educate people so that they are knowledgeable about these problems and can be supportive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>Clare Hennig is managing editor.

Although no such statistics exist for NYU Abu Dhabi or other universities in the region, a lack of official numbers does not mean the issue itself is non-existent. Three NYUAD students opened up to share their stories about anorexia, bulimia and recovery both on and off campus.\n<h3>\u201cYOU HAVE YOUR LIFE IN YOUR OWN HANDS\u201d</h3>\n\u201cIn [my home country], a girl is only considered pretty if she is skinny. That just goes hand in hand,\u201d said Victoria, who asked that her real name not be used.\n\nLeaning back against the plush chair in my living room, fingers curled around a mug of tea, she began to tell her story of bulimia. Her eating disorder, she said, had a very clear starting point; while on holiday with her parents during a school break, she inadvertently lost a couple of pounds and enjoyed the reactions she received.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back to school, my peers, for some reason, had a very easy time noticing that I had lost weight and they started making comments about how good I looked,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never heard that before \u2026 and I really liked it.\u201d\n\nVictoria went home after school that day and, with the praise of her friends still echoing in her mind, decided that she didn\u2019t feel hungry. She embarked on a diet, focusing on eating healthily at first.\n\n\u201cI lost some more weight,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I started throwing up after every meal because I realized that there were some days when I was super hungry and I was eating like I used to.\u201d\n\nHer parents must have realized what was happening, she said, when they heard her purging after meals. At one point, her mother had to take her shopping nearly every week to buy clothes in smaller and smaller sizes. Victoria appreciated that they did not directly intervene, however, but instead supported her while making the costs of continuing clear.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for all the girls and guys out there who have had an eating disorder but for me, it was about having control in my life,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cBulimia and eating disorders in general make you feel very much like you are in control. You know that almost everyone out there wants to lose weight \u2026 And when you start losing weight so rapidly, you realize that you\u2019ve got this. You have your life in your own hands.\u201d\n\nEventually, however, Victoria felt that her bulimia was spiraling out of control. She knew it had to stop. Although she is very grateful that bulimia is no longer a part of her life, she said she wouldn\u2019t take back that period of her life if she had the chance.\n\n\u201cIf I could turn back time, I wouldn\u2019t do anything differently,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cTo begin with, I don\u2019t know if I would even be here at this amazing university had it not been for bulimia and the huge jump in my GPA \u2026 and it taught me about my relationships with my friends and my parents, and with myself and my body, with academics, everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to recognize that, but it\u2019s not always such a bad thing. This sounds twisted and bad, but I really think so,\u201d she added.\n<h3>DE-GLAMORIZING ANOREXIA</h3>\nMonica, who also requested that her name not be published, emphasized that she did not want to glamorize her eating disorder in any way.\n\n\u201cTalking about it is so important because as long as you think it is glamorous and as long as you think you are doing the best thing for you \u2014 which you will think when you have an eating disorder \u2014 it\u2019s easy to associate eating disorders with notions of beauty or control or purity, these kind of abstract ideals that really at the core of it don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said.\n\nShe painted a brutal picture of what it was like to live with an eating disorder and of how bad her anorexia became for her health and well-being.\n\n\u201cWhen I see photos of myself then, yeah, I looked vaguely presentable with enough makeup,\u201d Monica said. \u201cBut my eyes were sallow and I looked sick. I was bruised all over. I couldn\u2019t lay on my bed because my bones were digging into me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d she added. \u201cBut until you start sharing those anecdotes with other women, you think that what we present on the street is what we are, which is not the case.\u201d\n\nMonica and I were in the library late at night, and had wandered off to find a secluded place to talk away from the florescent lights and clacking of keyboards in the common area. We eventually settled in the back, hidden amongst a row of books, and talked for more than an hour.\n\nMonica told me that she had counted calories and restricted food since about the age of eleven, but her eating disorder worsened during the gap between high school and university. A lot was happening in her personal and home life at the time, and the drive she would have devoted to academics found its release in starvation and self-destructive behaviors. Starting university did not put an end to it, but only made it much worse.\n\n\u201cThe ability to be anonymous in college and to pass things off as \u2018Oh, I have too much work\u2019 \u2014 which is always the case here \u2014 it made it much easier to escalate things,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are in that mindset, it\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d\n\nA few weeks before the end of her freshman year, she had to take a leave of absence.\n\n\u201cWhen I had to take my medical leave, I had no idea what was happening,\u201d said Monica. \u201cI thought I might be kicked out of school because when you take a mental health leave, you think, \u2018Do they even want me back?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c[That] made me freak out and clamp down even more,\u201d she added. \u201cThings were bad when I started in Abu Dhabi, but they were much worse when I left Abu Dhabi. I basically stopped eating.\u201d\n\nAt some point while she was away, however, a combination of things made her aware of the dark side of anorexia and nurtured a desire to overcome it.

Every day I felt pressured from my professors, peers and myself to have the best internship, lead a Student Interest Group, get straight A\u2019s and start writing a game-changing capstone. I was also in a completely new and foreign environment. I was constantly overwhelmed, I felt obliged to stay busy and I thought I couldn\u2019t talk to my friends about feeling stressed.</p>\n\n<p>I should have been able to put up with all this pressure, right? I was at the World\u2019s Honors College after all. But after two years of being an NYUAD student, I started to crack. I could never free myself from the looming expectations. Even during the summer I thought I had to intern, take a class or do research at the least. I was also surrounded by some of the world\u2019s most successful students, a fact NYUAD would often remind us of. Under these conditions, I definitely had no time for a break; I needed to keep performing and stay competitive. I was also afraid to talk to my friends about all the pressure because I thought feeling stressed was expected of us. By prioritizing my GPA and C.V. over my mental health, I was setting myself up for failure.</p>\n\n<p>By staying busy it became impossible for me to realize that my stress had reached a critical state. I should have spoken more openly about my stress to my friends. As a community, we also need to speak more openly about stress. Rather than comparing workloads, we need to shift our focus towards checking in with one another. Simply asking someone how they are \u201cfeeling today\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it. Sometimes this simple question put me on edge, because I didn\u2019t think I could answer honestly. If you care about your friends, take time to sit down with them and try to understand how their day is really going. Real conversations about how we\u2019re feeling can make the difference between becoming overwhelmed or not. In order for our community to effectively tackle issues of mental health, we need to start talking.</p>\n\n<p>We also need to talk more openly with the school about mental health to develop the best support for students. When I spoke with Dean of Students David Tinagero, he told me the university\u2019s role is to \u201cmake sure that we provide you with the support you need in whatever context you find yourself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So it\u2019s all up to us, we just need to visit Dean Tinagero and ask for the support we need. Don\u2019t wait for you or your friend to buckle under the pressure; if we begin openly discussing mental health at NYUAD today, we can make ourselves a lot happier.</p>\n\n<p>I thought I could wait out the four years of my degree before needing time off, but because of stress, I ended up suddenly leaving Abu Dhabi for a break this semester. No matter how well I could ignore the pressures of being an NYUAD student, they were constantly taking a toll on my mental health. But these pressures didn\u2019t have to be ignored, they didn\u2019t have to take a toll on my mental health and we can change that today. Go and sit down with a friend this week and find out how they feel about the pressures in their life. Discuss ways our school could offer support to address these pressures. Most importantly, keep talking about mental health.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor's Note: This article was written when Dave Tinagero was still Dean of Students.

I was also afraid to talk to my friends about all the pressure because I thought feeling stressed was expected of us. By prioritizing my GPA and C.V. over my mental health, I was setting myself up for failure.\n\nBy staying busy it became impossible for me to realize that my stress had reached a critical state. I should have spoken more openly about my stress to my friends. As a community, we also need to speak more openly about stress. Rather than comparing workloads, we need to shift our focus towards checking in with one another. Simply asking someone how they are \u201cfeeling today\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it. Sometimes this simple question put me on edge, because I didn\u2019t think I could answer honestly. If you care about your friends, take time to sit down with them and try to understand how their day is really going. Real conversations about how we\u2019re feeling can make the difference between becoming overwhelmed or not. In order for our community to effectively tackle issues of mental health, we need to start talking.\n\nWe also need to talk more openly with the school about mental health to develop the best support for students. When I spoke with Dean of Students David Tinagero, he told me the university\u2019s role is to \u201cmake sure that we provide you with the support you need in whatever context you find yourself.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s all up to us, we just need to visit Dean Tinagero and ask for the support we need. Don\u2019t wait for you or your friend to buckle under the pressure; if we begin openly discussing mental health at NYUAD today, we can make ourselves a lot happier.\n\nI thought I could wait out the four years of my degree before needing time off, but because of stress, I ended up suddenly leaving Abu Dhabi for a break this semester. No matter how well I could ignore the pressures of being an NYUAD student, they were constantly taking a toll on my mental health. But these pressures didn\u2019t have to be ignored, they didn\u2019t have to take a toll on my mental health and we can change that today. Go and sit down with a friend this week and find out how they feel about the pressures in their life. Discuss ways our school could offer support to address these pressures. Most importantly, keep talking about mental health.\n\n<em>Editor's Note: This article was written when Dave Tinagero was still Dean of Students. Since fall 2015, Kyle Farley has been the new Dean of Students at NYUAD. \n\nThere are many resources available for students seeking support for mental health issues, the dean's office being one of them. Students are also encouraged to reach out to the Health and Wellness Center, the Wellness Exchange and the peer support group REACH.</em>\n\n<em>James Smoley is a contributing writer.

We\u2019ve all heard the shocking statistics that tout tobacco use as the top contributor to preventable death and disease. Even with all of the peer-reviewed and validated research on the harms of tobacco in all of its many forms, we have yet to make strides in smoking cessation on a global scale. As two current medical students, we are inundated daily with the importance of obtaining an accurate social history, making sure to document any use of tobacco, and, if necessary, employ motivational interviewing skills to assess our patient\u2019s desire to quit smoking.</p>\n\n<p>We are going into the business of ensuring that people live long and healthy lives, and a large part of that equation is preventing future illness. Central to preventative medicine is modifying behavior. Behavior is the hardest to change and influence as a health professional, yet it contributes more to your health outcomes than the quality of healthcare you receive, the environment in which you live, or even your genetics.</p>\n\n<p>When thinking about possible capstone projects, we knew that these health behaviors were something that we would like to tackle, especially with the rise of unhealthy lifestyle trends in the UAE as evinced by the sharp rise in obesity, heart disease and type II diabetes. Just over 19 percent of the population has type II diabetes, which is usually associated with poor dietary and physical activity standards. Research also shows the alarming rise of tobacco use among the country\u2019s youth. In one study, 12 percent of males aged 13 to 15 responded as current cigarette smokers. This is alarming; many behavioral experts agree that the teenage years are extremely formative in terms of the habits that we will carry into and reinforce in late adolescence and beyond. If we were to design an intervention to positively influence health behaviors, it would make sense to target a cohort in their teens.</p>\n\n<p>As we discussed what a possible intervention to address these trends would look like, we couldn\u2019t help but think that our experience as health educators in inner-city schools in the boroughs of New York could be manipulated to fit the cultural context of Abu Dhabi. An important aspect of this intervention would be the peer-to-peer aspect of its implementation. Our time volunteering in New York and numerous research studies from the United States and the United Kingdom convinced us that the efficacy of health education was amplified when peers were teaching it. We designed and implemented a workshop on tobacco in several private secondary schools within Abu Dhabi, along with a pre and post-survey to assess its efficacy.</p>\n\n<p>This cohort was challenging in many ways, as we hoped not only to equip them with knowledge to make informed decisions about their health but also to confront respectfully the cultural norms that surround many forms of tobacco in the Middle East. For many of our students, tobacco use was something they positively associated with friends and family. As such, we decided to focus on empowering our students to care about their health and to speak out. The impacts of tobacco use on health are serious enough that no cultural norm or familial dynamic should keep anyone silent. In the classroom, the students were engaged, curious and, at times, shocked by the information we synthesized from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.</p>\n\n<p>But what did the survey data reveal? First, that a large percentage of the teens involved in our study were already experimenting with tobacco. Over 39 percent of the males we surveyed had tried shisha between the ages of 12 and 13. Other findings included signs of possible underlying eating disorders, insufficient levels of physical activity and several misconceptions regarding tobacco use, namely shisha and dokha. Many were under the assumption that shisha, for example, was less harmful to their health than cigarette smoking; current scientific research disputes that commonly held notion.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, these students were not in the optimal position to form habits to support lifelong health. Our survey analysis showed that our peer health model was an effective intervention for changing knowledge, attitudes and perspectives on tobacco use in the UAE. Our results call attention to an important educational gap in the UAE. Health education is not an integrated part of the schooling system, and it has been proven to play a valuable role in the lives of teenagers in this cultural setting. If it was effective for tobacco use, imagine how much more preventive impact we might have if schools were to expand to a comprehensive health curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a generation of people that do not like to be told what to do. How often has a health professional told you to eat healthier, be more physically active or consider tobacco cessation? If we fail to empower people with the knowledge and skills to make healthy decisions at an early age, then the knee-jerk, scripted health advice will not make meaningful changes. It is tempting, and perhaps human nature, to avoid or procrastinate addressing the behaviors we engage in that are detrimental to our health. The consequences seem far away \u2014 an easily ignored outcome that is more likely to happen to someone else. Some people cling to anecdotes of others who have adopted these behaviors their whole lives without any health-related repercussions.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone is as fortunate, though. The number of patients with a tobacco-related condition continues to climb and increasingly strain the healthcare system. The stories are devastating because they are preventable. However difficult it may be, the push for preventative measures is more important now than ever before. The WHO estimates that around 6 million people die each year from tobacco use. That number is so large that it can be hard to appreciate, but it\u2019s still is something that we should all be concerned about.

This may or may not come as a surprise to most people. But it prompts questions about another recent development on health in the news: athletes living a plant-based lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p>Simply because athletes partake in rigorous training regiments, and place high demands on their musculoskeletal system, many question whether it's possible for them to have adequate protein intake when following a plant-based diet. My aim is not necessarily to say that every single human being on the planet should follow a plant-based diet, nor is it to scold or guilt anyone into living this way; my goal is to broaden general knowledge relating to various different vegetarian diets and inform people that healthy nutrition with a plant-based diet is possible \u2013 even for those athletes following a training routine.</p>\n\n<p>I recently surveyed a group of NYU Abu Dhabi athletes who adhere to some form of vegetarianism to determine if they feel their meatless diet has any effect on their training or sport performance. These athletes participate competitively in a university sport, and train four to five times a week. Most responded that they had never been diagnosed with a protein deficiency, and that they weren\u2019t familiar or aware of what the associated symptoms of protein deficiency were or would feel like. </p>\n\n<p>Many stated that they felt nourished and satisfied on a daily basis, with energy being consistent throughout their days, and they did not experience highs and lows in energy levels. Some reported that they took dietary supplements, based on preference or as prescribed by a professional, to replace what they felt was lacking in their diet. Some stated that since making a transition to a meatless diet, they feel better overall than they did on their previous diet and note increased energy. Rich Roll, a famous triathlete, is a great example of an athletic role model who follows a strictly plant-based diet. Scott Jurek, a vegan ultramarathoner, broke the record in July of this year for fastest completion of the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike.</p>\n\n<p>I am not vegan or vegetarian. But beginning three years ago, I significantly reduced the meat and animal products in my diet, adopting a strictly plant-based, gluten-free diet for two years after consulting with a naturopath. At the time, I also began a 90-minute yoga routine, six days a week, and as I found myself twisting into postures I didn\u2019t know were humanly possible, I started to pay more attention to the foods I was putting in my body, and realized I had never felt better. </p>\n\n<p>Now I will occasionally indulge in wine and cheese at social events \u2014 and enjoy every moment. When I moved to the Middle East and had the chance to try a real, authentic chicken shawarma, I also took that opportunity, and enjoyed every bite. Overtime, I became less absolute with my restrictions and decided that it was fine if I strayed from them occasionally, though I will always eat a plant-dominant diet, simply because when I do, I feel better.</p>\n\n<p>People who grew up on a meat-and-potatoes diet may not be willing or able to transition directly to strict plant-based living. As an attempt to gradually reduce meat or other animal products in your life, you may consider a less-drastic variation initially, before going 100 percent plant-based. Pescetarianism involves eliminating meat from land animals while eating seafood.</p>\n\n<p>People respond differently to certain foods depending on their genetics, and not everyone will find removing meat from their diet suitable to their own needs, beliefs and preferences. Some people have tried to consume a meat-free diet, and they simply cannot find a way to make it work for them. They feel fatigued, lethargic and drained of energy throughout their entire day; this may relate to improper substitution of protein, or decreased caloric intake. However, in a case such as this, I believe meat-free diets should not be forced. Part of being aware and mindful about healthy living, is realizing what is not beneficial for you.</p>\n\n<p>Being a certified athletic trainer for the past 10 years has helped me to realize that I am passionate about all forms of health. I love movement \u2014 all forms of it \u2014 and I believe yoga and exercise is the best medicine for everyone. But apart from that, being an athletic trainer has helped me to focus on human performance. And taking notice of what athletes consume, and how it relates to their performance, has fueled my career and passion of promoting healthful living. A common term going around recently is mindful eating. When we are mindful about what we are consuming on a daily basis, and when we pay attention to what works with our specific system and what does not, we will learn the most optimal way to fuel our bodies. </p>\n\n<p>Arguably, the main reasons people refuse to attempt a plant-based diet are misinformation or cultural indoctrination. We often hear the term \u201crabbit food\u201d associated with vegetarianism. But transitioning to plant-based eating does not mean you live off of lettuce. I have had some butternut squash and lentil stews in the campus dining halls that have more texture and flavor than a steak. Learning how to cook with different spices and how to replace protein and minerals is the key to plant-based diets. </p>\n\n<p>A general misconception is that protein can only be consumed via meat, and other animal products. Most people do not understand that one cup of lentils contains 18 grams of protein, which is almost half of the recommended intake for an average, active, adult female. Vegetables such as peas, brussel sprouts, spinach; grains such as rice, quinoa and whole wheat pasta; and nuts and seeds such as hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds and almonds, all contain significant amount of protein.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in trying a plant-based diet, make a gradual transition. And instead of simply eliminating, go for replacement. This will help you feel satisfied. For instance, cow\u2019s milk can be replaced with almond, rice, soy or coconut milk and dairy spreads can be replaced with hummus or avocado. Make pasta, chili and casseroles with black beans instead of ground beef. Have a vegetable pizza, without the cheese. For plant-based proteins, try quinoa, tofu or chickpeas. And if you are feeling unsuccessful, seek the advice of a trained professional, such as a nutritionist or natural medicine doctor.</p>\n\n<p>I can confidently say that the benefits of a plant-based or meat-free diet are plentiful and include increased energy, improved digestion, clearer skin, improved weight management, decreased abdominal bloating, improved sleep patterns and feeling refreshed upon wakening.</p>\n\n<p>Increased discussion of plant-based diets on social media attests to rising interest and curiosity on an international scale. The concept of Meatless Mondays is gaining popularity on social media. I believe that the general public is starting to obtain knowledge about living a plant-based lifestyle and are increasingly more willing to try it out. As people gradually make these healthful substitutions, and start to feel the benefits, meat and dairy seem less integral to a complete diet. </p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t think of this as a diet, as a deprivation of something. Like Socrates said, \u201cThe secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>Karly Melnyk is a contributing writer.

Most responded that they had never been diagnosed with a protein deficiency, and that they weren\u2019t familiar or aware of what the associated symptoms of protein deficiency were or would feel like. \n\nMany stated that they felt nourished and satisfied on a daily basis, with energy being consistent throughout their days, and they did not experience highs and lows in energy levels. Some reported that they took dietary supplements, based on preference or as prescribed by a professional, to replace what they felt was lacking in their diet. Some stated that since making a transition to a meatless diet, they feel better overall than they did on their previous diet and note increased energy. Rich Roll, a famous triathlete, is a great example of an athletic role model who follows a strictly plant-based diet. Scott Jurek, a vegan ultramarathoner, broke the record in July of this year for fastest completion of the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike.\n\nI am not vegan or vegetarian. But beginning three years ago, I significantly reduced the meat and animal products in my diet, adopting a strictly plant-based, gluten-free diet for two years after consulting with a naturopath. At the time, I also began a 90-minute yoga routine, six days a week, and as I found myself twisting into postures I didn\u2019t know were humanly possible, I started to pay more attention to the foods I was putting in my body, and realized I had never felt better. \n\nNow I will occasionally indulge in wine and cheese at social events \u2014 and enjoy every moment. When I moved to the Middle East and had the chance to try a real, authentic chicken shawarma, I also took that opportunity, and enjoyed every bite. Overtime, I became less absolute with my restrictions and decided that it was fine if I strayed from them occasionally, though I will always eat a plant-dominant diet, simply because when I do, I feel better.\n\nPeople who grew up on a meat-and-potatoes diet may not be willing or able to transition directly to strict plant-based living. As an attempt to gradually reduce meat or other animal products in your life, you may consider a less-drastic variation initially, before going 100 percent plant-based. Pescetarianism involves eliminating meat from land animals while eating seafood.\n\nPeople respond differently to certain foods depending on their genetics, and not everyone will find removing meat from their diet suitable to their own needs, beliefs and preferences. Some people have tried to consume a meat-free diet, and they simply cannot find a way to make it work for them. They feel fatigued, lethargic and drained of energy throughout their entire day; this may relate to improper substitution of protein, or decreased caloric intake. However, in a case such as this, I believe meat-free diets should not be forced. Part of being aware and mindful about healthy living, is realizing what is not beneficial for you.\n\nBeing a certified athletic trainer for the past 10 years has helped me to realize that I am passionate about all forms of health. I love movement \u2014 all forms of it \u2014 and I believe yoga and exercise is the best medicine for everyone. But apart from that, being an athletic trainer has helped me to focus on human performance. And taking notice of what athletes consume, and how it relates to their performance, has fueled my career and passion of promoting healthful living. A common term going around recently is mindful eating. When we are mindful about what we are consuming on a daily basis, and when we pay attention to what works with our specific system and what does not, we will learn the most optimal way to fuel our bodies. \n\nArguably, the main reasons people refuse to attempt a plant-based diet are misinformation or cultural indoctrination. We often hear the term \u201crabbit food\u201d associated with vegetarianism. But transitioning to plant-based eating does not mean you live off of lettuce. I have had some butternut squash and lentil stews in the campus dining halls that have more texture and flavor than a steak. Learning how to cook with different spices and how to replace protein and minerals is the key to plant-based diets. \n\nA general misconception is that protein can only be consumed via meat, and other animal products. Most people do not understand that one cup of lentils contains 18 grams of protein, which is almost half of the recommended intake for an average, active, adult female. Vegetables such as peas, brussel sprouts, spinach; grains such as rice, quinoa and whole wheat pasta; and nuts and seeds such as hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds and almonds, all contain significant amount of protein.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying a plant-based diet, make a gradual transition. And instead of simply eliminating, go for replacement. This will help you feel satisfied. For instance, cow\u2019s milk can be replaced with almond, rice, soy or coconut milk and dairy spreads can be replaced with hummus or avocado. Make pasta, chili and casseroles with black beans instead of ground beef. Have a vegetable pizza, without the cheese. For plant-based proteins, try quinoa, tofu or chickpeas. And if you are feeling unsuccessful, seek the advice of a trained professional, such as a nutritionist or natural medicine doctor.\n\nI can confidently say that the benefits of a plant-based or meat-free diet are plentiful and include increased energy, improved digestion, clearer skin, improved weight management, decreased abdominal bloating, improved sleep patterns and feeling refreshed upon wakening.\n\nIncreased discussion of plant-based diets on social media attests to rising interest and curiosity on an international scale. The concept of Meatless Mondays is gaining popularity on social media. I believe that the general public is starting to obtain knowledge about living a plant-based lifestyle and are increasingly more willing to try it out. As people gradually make these healthful substitutions, and start to feel the benefits, meat and dairy seem less integral to a complete diet. \n\nDon\u2019t think of this as a diet, as a deprivation of something. Like Socrates said, \u201cThe secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.\u201d\n\n<em>Karly Melnyk is a contributing writer.

I knew it was going to be hard. I didn\u2019t know why, but everyone said so, and majority rules. As I now watch my younger sister near her 14th birthday, I understand the widespread belief that 14 is a hard year: boys, hormones and mean girls. I wish with all my heart that that is as hard as it gets for my baby sister. My 14 was a little bit harder.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t remember exactly how it happened, or why I knew to notice such a thing, but a few months after my 14th birthday I noticed a lump close to my armpit. Lump, in my mind, equaled cancer, or the possibility of cancer, so I told my mom. My mom told my dad, my dad told his aunt, his aunt told her oncologist. A couple of days later I went to visit the oncologist right after dinner at my grandparents\u2019 house.</p>\n\n<p>He made small talk with my mom, told me about the new school his daughter moved to and inquired after my dad\u2019s aunt\u2019s health. He then led me into a small room as my mom waited outside \u2014 she didn\u2019t think it was anything significant. A couple of minutes later I put on my shirt and followed him outside, all the while thinking how white the room was and how uncomfortable it made me feel. I was not scared, though. I was resigned, annoyed and slightly cold, but not scared. The oncologist sat down at his desk, looked at my mom and told her we would have to do some more tests because \u201cit could be\u201d or \u201cit might be.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I cannot remember my mom\u2019s immediate reaction, but knowing her she probably tried to keep her composure for my sake. I remember my reaction, though. All I could think was, \u201cWhat about my family? What would happen to them if I died? How would my sister feel? Would my parents be okay?\u201d I wasn\u2019t scared or worried by the idea of my death. I just did not want them to go through the pain of losing a daughter or a sister. I also knew I did not want to go through chemo; I saw my dad\u2019s cousin-in-law go through the same treatment and I saw how it affected her last days. I didn\u2019t want that. I wanted to spend every last moment I had being fully myself. Perhaps I was being na\u00efve, perhaps that was my own brand of shock, but my 14-year-old self knew what she wanted and was willing to stick with it.</p>\n\n<p>It was a hard time for the whole family. My mom and dad breathed prayers, hoping to God that it was benign. My dad was different, not his smiling, joking, usually loud self. I have never seen him like that since then. My sister was only seven, but even she knew something was wrong, even she was worried. My mom lost her optimism, but stayed calm and composed for me. Looking back at that time between the first and the last doctor\u2019s visit, it feels like it had been months on end, but in reality, it was probably three or four weeks at most.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing their worry even before any results came out intensified my own worry; I thought and thought and still could not come up with any way to make this easier on them. What do you do when you don\u2019t want to put those you love through pain, but know you might end up doing it anyway? Isn\u2019t it better to just do it quicker? I was not considering suicide, but I truly thought refusing treatment would put them through less trauma. I planned to tell them the moment we got the results \u2014 I didn\u2019t think there was any hope it was going to be benign. I later found out that my cousin and best friend, who had been living abroad at the time, also knew about \u201cthe lump.\u201d She told me afterwards how she sat in her room, Googling cancer, lumps and chemotherapy, how she cried. How I would have cried had I known she was also worrying.</p>\n\n<p>When the time came to find out the results, we all went to the doctor. I have never felt the amount of fear I felt then again, not when I later realized I had been in a car-crash, not when I thought the plane I was on was catching fire, not when I was on a rooftop during the revolution in Egypt, watching out for men with machine guns who might attack at any given moment. I have never been as scared as I was then because my fear was totally and absolutely focused on my loved ones. Me, I can control, I can work on. But the thought that their lives could be so severely disturbed because of me was so terrifying, it still brings me to tears.</p>\n\n<p>The moment the four of us walked into his office, the doctor informed us that the lump was benign. \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. I could see the elation, relief and tears in my parents eyes, the joy in my sister\u2019s, and it made me happier than the news itself. The rest of the conversation is a blur to me, but my parents later explained, in very unscientific terms, that due to my family history it may be that I am more susceptible to cancer than most, and so every lump presents a danger. Every lump must be examined, assessed and if we think for one second that \u201cit might be,\u201d we should make our way back to that white room.</p>\n\n<p>The two or three times a year I have found a lump since then, I consider checking it out on my own first, not informing them, not putting them through that pain. But I always end up telling them. I always tell them because no matter how much I don\u2019t really care what happens to me, I still care about having them next to me as it happens. Even if the idea of dying in a few months does not scare me, I still want them next to me so that I am able to process the news. As much as I wish that they never have to go through pain and worry, I still find myself selfish enough to inform them, worry them, every time. And every time, they have worried over something that \u201cisn\u2019t.\u201d Alhamdulilah.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mariam El Zoghbi is a contributing writer. Email her at feedback@thegazelle.org.</em></p>",

Greens and browns will dominate; with words such as organic, natural and pure everywhere, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that you\u2019re at a 1960s hippie revival convention.</p>\n\n<p>Look closer, though, and the price tags will be double what one would pay for the non-organic flour, the unnatural confectionary and the impure bath soap. We take this for granted. Of course the products that take more time, eschew mass production and are made in Norway rather than Malaysia are going to cost more, but what are we paying for? In this aisle or this section, we\u2019re paying for the healthy option, the one that won\u2019t give us cancer and that won\u2019t poison the earth.</p>\n\n<p>All this is well and good \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t pay a little bit more if it meant that a river wasn\u2019t going to acidify, or you\u2019re not going to get cancer? Well, some people can\u2019t pay that little bit more. When your budget for buying these products is constrained, organic produce might seem nice, but savings are more important.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, if you\u2019re socioeconomically disadvantaged, it\u2019s much more likely that you\u2019re not going to live anywhere near a Wholefoods or a farmers\u2019 market. Many people who might be working multiple jobs, or working and studying at the same time, will be too poor to cook a meal and may have to revert to a cheaper fast food option. By encouraging the purchase of healthy and more expensive foods, are we stigmatizing those who may not be able to afford these foods as perennially unhealthy?</p>\n\n<p>When you\u2019re buying GMO-free, biodynamic produce, you\u2019re avoiding a product that may have been engineered to produce more off a small land area. There may not even be any benefit to buying the organic product over another. Even worse, it may be justifying the purchase of a product that shouldn\u2019t be grown in that area in the first place. How appropriate is it to buy particularly thirsty crops in an age in which droughts are lasting longer and occurring with more frequency? Does it really help to buy the organic cotton shirt, or biodynamic rice?</p>\n\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen with greenwashing, products that are more environmentally friendly don\u2019t save the world, and instead we\u2019re told to feel better about buying more, as if we can buy our way out of climate change.</p>\n\n<p>But we all tried that in the 2000s and nothing changed. Now we should focus on ourselves \u2014 let\u2019s buy more to stay healthy.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what counts as a healthy meal. Half a plate of vegetables, a quarter protein and a quarter carbs. But no matter how many times you show a well-rounded meal to someone or describe the calorie count in a McDonald\u2019s burger, it won\u2019t change the economic reality that foods described as healthy are more expensive and out of the reach for many people.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing to pathologize those who suffer from obesity, which is more prevalent in poorer communities, disguises the lack of options available to those on lower incomes. Arguing for healthy eating as an imperative, both for the individual and the body of the state, makes those who cannot afford to consume this way sick.</p>\n\n<p>Food is possibly the most obvious symptom of the classist implications of a healthy lifestyle discourse. However, it extends further. When we move from healthy eating to a healthy lifestyle, the discourse is even more discriminatory. We\u2019re told to exercise for 30 minutes every day. For those who are disadvantaged, it can be hard to find the time to go for a 30-minute run, let alone pay for a gym membership or athletic apparel. These imperatives placed upon individuals, who do not have the time or economic power to comply with them, leads to those who have less monetary resources being ostracized from the healthy society.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, and possibly most significantly, the cost of health services makes them prohibitive for those on lower incomes. Services that are not covered by one\u2019s private or public health insurance become extremely expensive, if one even has health insurance. Couched in the discourse of medical certainty, the requirements that are placed upon individuals to avail themselves of these services and their subsequent inability to pay for them leaves these people unable to stay healthy in the eyes of a society that is obsessed with the functioning of the collective body.</p>\n\n<p>We should shift our focus away from ways in which to encourage individuals to make healthy choices, such as buying organic food, exercising daily and using preventative medicine, to instead look at what makes some people unhealthy in the first place. More often than not, those who are unhealthy are already hampered by their socioeconomic standing, and the constant bleating of public health campaigns will do nothing to assuage this.</p>\n\n<p><em>Connor Pearce is news editor.

We take this for granted. Of course the products that take more time, eschew mass production and are made in Norway rather than Malaysia are going to cost more, but what are we paying for? In this aisle or this section, we\u2019re paying for the healthy option, the one that won\u2019t give us cancer and that won\u2019t poison the earth.\n\nAll this is well and good \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t pay a little bit more if it meant that a river wasn\u2019t going to acidify, or you\u2019re not going to get cancer? Well, some people can\u2019t pay that little bit more. When your budget for buying these products is constrained, organic produce might seem nice, but savings are more important.\n\nIndeed, if you\u2019re socioeconomically disadvantaged, it\u2019s much more likely that you\u2019re not going to live anywhere near a Wholefoods or a farmers\u2019 market. Many people who might be working multiple jobs, or working and studying at the same time, will be too poor to cook a meal and may have to revert to a cheaper fast food option. By encouraging the purchase of healthy and more expensive foods, are we stigmatizing those who may not be able to afford these foods as perennially unhealthy?\n\nWhen you\u2019re buying GMO-free, biodynamic produce, you\u2019re avoiding a product that may have been engineered to produce more off a small land area. There may not even be any benefit to buying the organic product over another. Even worse, it may be justifying the purchase of a product that shouldn\u2019t be grown in that area in the first place. How appropriate is it to buy particularly thirsty crops in an age in which droughts are lasting longer and occurring with more frequency? Does it really help to buy the organic cotton shirt, or biodynamic rice?\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen with greenwashing, products that are more environmentally friendly don\u2019t save the world, and instead we\u2019re told to feel better about buying more, as if we can buy our way out of climate change.\n\nBut we all tried that in the 2000s and nothing changed. Now we should focus on ourselves \u2014 let\u2019s buy more to stay healthy.\n\nThink about what counts as a healthy meal. Half a plate of vegetables, a quarter protein and a quarter carbs. But no matter how many times you show a well-rounded meal to someone or describe the calorie count in a McDonald\u2019s burger, it won\u2019t change the economic reality that foods described as healthy are more expensive and out of the reach for many people.\n\nContinuing to pathologize those who suffer from obesity, which is more prevalent in poorer communities, disguises the lack of options available to those on lower incomes. Arguing for healthy eating as an imperative, both for the individual and the body of the state, makes those who cannot afford to consume this way sick.\n\nFood is possibly the most obvious symptom of the classist implications of a healthy lifestyle discourse. However, it extends further. When we move from healthy eating to a healthy lifestyle, the discourse is even more discriminatory. We\u2019re told to exercise for 30 minutes every day. For those who are disadvantaged, it can be hard to find the time to go for a 30-minute run, let alone pay for a gym membership or athletic apparel. These imperatives placed upon individuals, who do not have the time or economic power to comply with them, leads to those who have less monetary resources being ostracized from the healthy society.\n\nFinally, and possibly most significantly, the cost of health services makes them prohibitive for those on lower incomes. Services that are not covered by one\u2019s private or public health insurance become extremely expensive, if one even has health insurance. Couched in the discourse of medical certainty, the requirements that are placed upon individuals to avail themselves of these services and their subsequent inability to pay for them leaves these people unable to stay healthy in the eyes of a society that is obsessed with the functioning of the collective body.\n\nWe should shift our focus away from ways in which to encourage individuals to make healthy choices, such as buying organic food, exercising daily and using preventative medicine, to instead look at what makes some people unhealthy in the first place. More often than not, those who are unhealthy are already hampered by their socioeconomic standing, and the constant bleating of public health campaigns will do nothing to assuage this.\n\n<em>Connor Pearce is news editor.
